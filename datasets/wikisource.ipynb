Argued October 8, 2013—Decided April 2, 2014\\nThe right to participate in democracy through political contributions is\\n  protected by the First Amendment, but that right is not absolute.\\n  Congress may regulate campaign contributions to protect against\\n  corruption or the appearance of corruption. See, e.g., Buckley v.\\n  Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 26–27. It may not, however, regulate contribu-\\n  tions simply to reduce the amount of money in politics, or to restrict\\n  the political participation of some in order to enhance the relative in-\\n  fluence of others. See, e.g., Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s Freedom\\n  Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U. S. ___, ___.\\n     The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended\\n  by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), imposes\\n  two types of limits on campaign contributions. Base limits restrict\\n  how much money a donor may contribute to a particular candidate or\\n  committee while aggregate limits restrict how much money a donor\\n  may contribute in total to all candidates or committees. 2 U. S. C.\\n  §441a.\\n     In the 2011–2012 election cycle, appellant McCutcheon contributed\\n  to 16 different federal candidates, complying with the base limits ap-\\n  plicable to each. He alleges that the aggregate limits prevented him\\n  from contributing to 12 additional candidates and to a number of\\n  noncandidate political committees. He also alleges that he wishes to\\n  make similar contributions in the future, all within the base limits.\\n  McCutcheon and appellant Republican National Committee filed a\\n  complaint before a three-judge District Court, asserting that the ag-\\n  gregate limits were unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\\n  The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction\\n  and granted the Government’s motion to dismiss. Assuming that the\\n\\x0c2          MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                                Syllabus\\n\\n    base limits appropriately served the Government’s anticorruption in-\\n    terest, the District Court concluded that the aggregate limits sur-\\n    vived First Amendment scrutiny because they prevented evasion of\\n    the base limits.\\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\\n893 F. Supp. 2d 133, reversed and remanded.\\n     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNE-\\n  DY, and JUSTICE ALITO, concluded that the aggregate limits are inva-\\n  lid under the First Amendment. Pp. 7–40.\\n     (a) Appellants’ substantial First Amendment challenge to the cur-\\n  rent system of aggregate limits merits plenary consideration. Pp. 7–\\n  14.\\n       (1) In Buckley, this Court evaluated the constitutionality of the\\n  original contribution and expenditure limits in FECA. Buckley dis-\\n  tinguished the two types of limits based on the degree to which each\\n  encroaches upon protected First Amendment interests. It subjected\\n  expenditure limits to “the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations\\n  on core First Amendment rights of political expression.” 424 U. S., at\\n  44–45. But it concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser re-\\n  straint on political speech and thus applied a lesser but still “rigorous\\n  standard of review,” id., at 29, under which such limits “may be sus-\\n  tained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and\\n  employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of\\n  associational freedoms,” id., at 25. Because the Court found that the\\n  primary purpose of FECA—preventing quid pro quo corruption and\\n  its appearance—was a “sufficiently important” governmental inter-\\n  est, id., at 26–27, it upheld the base limit under the “closely drawn”\\n  test, id., at 29. After doing so, the Court devoted only one paragraph\\n  of its 139-page opinion to the aggregate limit then in place under\\n  FECA, noting that the provision “ha[d] not been separately addressed\\n  at length by the parties.” Id., at 38. It concluded that the aggregate\\n  limit served to prevent circumvention of the base limit and was “no\\n  more than a corollary” of that limit. Id., at 38. Pp. 7–9.\\n       (2) There is no need in this case to revisit Buckley’s distinction\\n  between contributions and expenditures and the corresponding dis-\\n  tinction in standards of review. Regardless whether strict scrutiny or\\n  the “closely drawn” test applies, the analysis turns on the fit between\\n  the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve\\n  that objective. Here, given the substantial mismatch between the\\n  Government’s stated objective and the means selected to achieve it,\\n  the aggregate limits fail even under the “closely drawn” test.\\n     Buckley’s ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the ag-\\n  gregate limit in place under FECA does not control here. Buckley\\n  spent just three sentences analyzing that limit, which had not been\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\\n\\n                              Syllabus\\n\\nseparately addressed by the parties. Appellants here, by contrast,\\nhave directly challenged the aggregate limits in place under BCRA, a\\ndifferent statutory regime whose limits operate against a distinct le-\\ngal backdrop. Most notably, statutory safeguards against circumven-\\ntion have been considerably strengthened since Buckley. The 1976\\nFECA Amendments added another layer of base limits—capping con-\\ntributions from individuals to political committees—and an antipro-\\nliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multi-\\nple affiliated political committees. Since Buckley, the Federal\\nElection Commission has also enacted an intricate regulatory scheme\\nthat further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base\\nlimits through “unearmarked contributions to political committees\\nlikely to contribute” to a particular candidate. 424 U. S., at 38. In\\naddition to accounting for such statutory and regulatory changes, ap-\\npellants raise distinct legal arguments not considered in Buckley, in-\\ncluding an overbreadth challenge to the aggregate limit. Pp. 10–14.\\n   (b) Significant First Amendment interests are implicated here.\\nContributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individual’s\\nright to participate in the electoral process through both political ex-\\npression and political association. A restriction on how many candi-\\ndates and committees an individual may support is hardly a “modest\\nrestraint” on those rights. The Government may no more restrict\\nhow many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell\\na newspaper how many candidates it may endorse. In its simplest\\nterms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contrib-\\nuting to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more\\ncandidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits. And\\nit is no response to say that the individual can simply contribute less\\nthan the base limits permit: To require one person to contribute at\\nlower levels because he wants to support more candidates or causes\\nis to penalize that individual for “robustly exercis[ing]” his First\\nAmendment rights. Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. 724,\\n739.\\n   In assessing the First Amendment interests at stake, the proper fo-\\ncus is on an individual’s right to engage in political speech, not a col-\\nlective conception of the public good. The whole point of the First\\nAmendment is to protect individual speech that the majority might\\nprefer to restrict, or that legislators or judges might not view as use-\\nful to the democratic process. Pp. 14–18.\\n   (c) The aggregate limits do not further the permissible governmen-\\ntal interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.\\nPp. 18–36.\\n      (1) This Court has identified only one legitimate governmental\\ninterest for restricting campaign finances: preventing corruption or\\n\\x0c4          MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                                   Syllabus\\n\\n    the appearance of corruption. See Davis, supra, at 741. Moreover,\\n    the only type of corruption that Congress may target is quid pro quo\\n    corruption. Spending large sums of money in connection with elec-\\n    tions, but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an\\n    officeholder’s official duties, does not give rise to quid pro quo corrup-\\n    tion. Nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large\\n    sums may garner “influence over or access to” elected officials or po-\\n    litical parties. Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S.\\n    310, 359. The line between quid pro quo corruption and general in-\\n    fluence must be respected in order to safeguard basic First Amend-\\n    ment rights, and the Court must “err on the side of protecting politi-\\n    cal speech rather than suppressing it.” Federal Election Comm’n v.\\n    Wisconsin Right to Life, 551 U. S. 449, 457 (opinion of ROBERTS,\\n    C. J.). Pp. 18–21.\\n         (2) The Government argues that the aggregate limits further the\\n    permissible objective of preventing quid pro quo corruption. The dif-\\n    ficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in, they ban all contribu-\\n    tions of any amount, even though Congress’s selection of a base limit\\n    indicates its belief that contributions beneath that amount do not\\n    create a cognizable risk of corruption. The Government must thus\\n    defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent cir-\\n    cumvention of the base limits, a function they do not serve in any\\n    meaningful way. Given the statutes and regulations currently in ef-\\n    fect, Buckley’s fear that an individual might “contribute massive\\n    amounts of money to a particular candidate through . . . unear-\\n    marked contributions” to entities likely to support the candidate, 424\\n    U. S., at 38, is far too speculative. Even accepting Buckley’s circum-\\n    vention theory, it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive\\n    “massive amounts of money” that could be traced back to a particular\\n    donor uninhibited by the aggregate limits. The Government’s scenar-\\n    ios offered in support of that possibility are either illegal under cur-\\n    rent campaign finance laws or implausible. Pp. 21–30.\\n         (3) The aggregate limits also violate the First Amendment be-\\n    cause they are not “closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of\\n    associational freedoms.” Buckley, supra, at 25. The Government ar-\\n    gues that the aggregate limits prevent an individual from giving to\\n    too many initial recipients who might then recontribute a donation,\\n    but experience suggests that the vast majority of contributions are\\n    retained and spent by their recipients. And the Government has pro-\\n    vided no reason to believe that candidates or party committees would\\n    dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted.\\n    The indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate lim-\\n    its is thus disproportionate to the Government’s interest in prevent-\\n    ing circumvention.\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\\n\\n                              Syllabus\\n\\n   Importantly, there are multiple alternatives available to Congress\\nthat would serve the Government’s interest in preventing circumven-\\ntion while avoiding “unnecessary abridgment” of First Amendment\\nrights. Buckley, supra, at 25. Such alternatives might include tar-\\ngeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political com-\\nmittees, or tighter earmarking rules. Transfers, after all, are the key\\nto the Government’s concern about circumvention, but they can be\\naddressed without such a direct and broad interference with First\\nAmendment rights. Pp. 30–35.\\n     (4) Disclosure of contributions also reduces the potential for\\nabuse of the campaign finance system. Disclosure requirements,\\nwhich are justified by “a governmental interest in ‘provid[ing] the\\nelectorate with information’ about the sources of election-related\\nspending,” Citizens United, supra, at 367, may deter corruption “by\\nexposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publici-\\nty,” Buckley, supra at 67. Disclosure requirements may burden\\nspeech, but they often represent a less restrictive alternative to flat\\nbans on certain types or quantities of speech. Particularly with mod-\\nern technology, disclosure now offers more robust protections against\\ncorruption than it did when Buckley was decided. Pp. 35–36.\\n   (d) The Government offers an additional rationale for the aggregate\\nlimits, arguing that the opportunity for corruption exists whenever a\\nlegislator is given a large check, even if the check consists of contri-\\nbutions within the base limits to be divided among numerous candi-\\ndates or committees. That rationale dangerously broadens the cir-\\ncumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in prior\\ncases. Buckley confined its analysis to the possibility that “massive\\namounts of money” could be funneled to a particular candidate in ex-\\ncess of the base limits. 424 U. S., at 38. Recasting as corruption a\\ndonor’s widely distributed support for a political party would dramat-\\nically expand government regulation of the political process. And\\nthough the Government suggests that solicitation of large contribu-\\ntions poses the corruption danger, the aggregate limits are not lim-\\nited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate. Pp. 36–\\n39.\\n   JUSTICE THOMAS agreed that the aggregate limits are invalid under\\nthe First Amendment, but would overrule Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.\\n1, and subject BCRA’s aggregate limits to strict scrutiny, which they\\nwould surely fail. Buckley’s “analytic foundation . . . was tenuous\\nfrom the very beginning and has only continued to erode in the inter-\\nvening years.” Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S.\\n377, 412 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).

Citi-\\nzens can exercise that right in a variety of ways: They can\\nrun for office themselves, vote, urge others to vote for a\\nparticular candidate, volunteer to work on a campaign,\\nand contribute to a candidate’s campaign. This case is\\nabout the last of those options.\\n   The right to participate in democracy through political\\ncontributions is protected by the First Amendment, but\\nthat right is not absolute. Our cases have held that Con-\\ngress may regulate campaign contributions to protect\\nagainst corruption or the appearance of corruption. See,\\ne.g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 26–27 (1976) (per curiam).\\nAt the same time, we have made clear that Congress\\nmay not regulate contributions simply to reduce the\\namount of money in politics, or to restrict the political\\nparticipation of some in order to enhance the relative\\ninfluence of others. See, e.g., Arizona Free Enterprise\\n\\x0c2       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nClub’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U. S. ___, ___\\n(2011) (slip op., at 24–25).\\n    Many people might find those latter objectives attrac-\\ntive: They would be delighted to see fewer television com-\\nmercials touting a candidate’s accomplishments or dispar-\\naging an opponent’s character. Money in politics may at\\ntimes seem repugnant to some, but so too does much of\\nwhat the First Amendment vigorously protects. If the\\nFirst Amendment protects flag burning, funeral protests,\\nand Nazi parades—despite the profound offense such\\nspectacles cause—it surely protects political campaign\\nspeech despite popular opposition. See Texas v. Johnson,\\n491 U. S. 397 (1989); Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___\\n(2011); National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432\\nU. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). Indeed, as we have empha-\\nsized, the First Amendment “has its fullest and most\\nurgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns\\nfor political office.” Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S.\\n265, 272 (1971).\\n    In a series of cases over the past 40 years, we have\\nspelled out how to draw the constitutional line between\\nthe permissible goal of avoiding corruption in the political\\nprocess and the impermissible desire simply to limit polit-\\nical speech. We have said that government regulation\\nmay not target the general gratitude a candidate may feel\\ntoward those who support him or his allies, or the political\\naccess such support may afford. “Ingratiation and access\\n. . . are not corruption.” Citizens United v. Federal Elec-\\ntion Comm’n, 558 U. S. 310, 360 (2010). They embody a\\ncentral feature of democracy—that constituents support\\ncandidates who share their beliefs and interests, and\\ncandidates who are elected can be expected to be respon-\\nsive to those concerns.\\n    Any regulation must instead target what we have called\\n“quid pro quo” corruption or its appearance. See id., at\\n359. That Latin phrase captures the notion of a direct\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

S. 257, 266 (1991). “The hallmark of\\ncorruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for po-\\nlitical favors.” Federal Election Comm’n v. National Con-\\nservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 497\\n(1985). Campaign finance restrictions that pursue other\\nobjectives, we have explained, impermissibly inject the\\nGovernment “into the debate over who should govern.”\\nBennett, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25). And those who\\ngovern should be the last people to help decide who should\\ngovern.\\n   The statute at issue in this case imposes two types of\\nlimits on campaign contributions. The first, called base\\nlimits, restricts how much money a donor may contribute\\nto a particular candidate or committee.         2 U. S. C.\\n§441a(a)(1). The second, called aggregate limits, restricts\\nhow much money a donor may contribute in total to all\\ncandidates or committees. §441a(a)(3).\\n   This case does not involve any challenge to the base\\nlimits, which we have previously upheld as serving the\\npermissible objective of combatting corruption. The Gov-\\nernment contends that the aggregate limits also serve that\\nobjective, by preventing circumvention of the base limits.\\nWe conclude, however, that the aggregate limits do little,\\nif anything, to address that concern, while seriously re-\\nstricting participation in the democratic process. The\\naggregate limits are therefore invalid under the First\\nAmendment.\\n                            I\\n\\n                            A\\n\\n  For the 2013–2014 election cycle, the base limits in the\\nFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as\\namended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002\\n(BCRA), permit an individual to contribute up to $2,600\\nper election to a candidate ($5,200 total for the primary\\n\\x0c4             MCCUTCHEON v.

If, for example, a donor gives money to a\\nparty committee but directs the party committee to pass\\nthe contribution along to a particular candidate, then the\\ntransaction is treated as a contribution from the original\\ndonor to the specified candidate.\\n  For the 2013–2014 election cycle, the aggregate limits in\\nBCRA permit an individual to contribute a total of $48,600\\nto federal candidates and a total of $74,600 to other politi-\\ncal committees.

S. District\\nCourt for the District of Columbia. See BCRA §403(a), 116\\nStat. 113–114. McCutcheon and the RNC asserted that\\nthe aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and to\\nnoncandidate political committees were unconstitutional\\nunder the First Amendment. They moved for a prelimi-\\nnary injunction against enforcement of the challenged\\nprovisions, and the Government moved to dismiss the\\ncase.\\n   The three-judge District Court denied appellants’ mo-\\ntion for a preliminary injunction and granted the Govern-\\nment’s motion to dismiss. Assuming that the base limits\\nappropriately served the Government’s anticorruption\\ninterest, the District Court concluded that the aggregate\\nlimits survived First Amendment scrutiny because they\\nprevented evasion of the base limits. 893 F. Supp. 2d 133,\\n140 (2012).\\n   In particular, the District Court imagined a hypothetical\\nscenario that might occur in a world without aggregate\\nlimits. A single donor might contribute the maximum\\namount under the base limits to nearly 50 separate com-\\nmittees, each of which might then transfer the money to\\nthe same single committee. Ibid. That committee, in\\nturn, might use all the transferred money for coordinated\\nexpenditures on behalf of a particular candidate, allowing\\nthe single donor to circumvent the base limit on the\\namount he may contribute to that candidate.

S. 1, presented this Court with\\nits first opportunity to evaluate the constitutionality of the\\noriginal contribution and expenditure limits set forth in\\nFECA. FECA imposed a $1,000 per election base limit on\\ncontributions from an individual to a federal candidate. It\\nalso imposed a $25,000 per year aggregate limit on all\\ncontributions from an individual to candidates or political\\ncommittees. 18 U. S. C. §§608(b)(1), 608(b)(3) (1970 ed.,\\nSupp. IV). On the expenditures side, FECA imposed\\nlimits on both independent expenditures and candidates’\\noverall campaign expenditures. §§608(e)(1), 608(c).\\n   Buckley recognized that “contribution and expenditure\\nlimitations operate in an area of the most fundamental\\nFirst Amendment activities.” 424 U. S., at 14. But it\\ndistinguished expenditure limits from contribution limits\\nbased on the degree to which each encroaches upon pro-\\ntected First Amendment interests. Expenditure limits,\\nthe Court explained, “necessarily reduce[ ] the quantity of\\nexpression by restricting the number of issues discussed,\\nthe depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience\\nreached.” Id., at 19. The Court thus subjected expendi-\\nture limits to “the exacting scrutiny applicable to lim-\\nitations on core First Amendment rights of political\\nexpression.” Id., at 44–45. Under exacting scrutiny, the\\n\\x0c8       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nGovernment may regulate protected speech only if such\\nregulation promotes a compelling interest and is the least\\nrestrictive means to further the articulated interest. See\\nSable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115,\\n126 (1989).\\n   By contrast, the Court concluded that contribution\\nlimits impose a lesser restraint on political speech because\\nthey “permit[ ] the symbolic expression of support evi-\\ndenced by a contribution but do[ ] not in any way infringe\\nthe contributor’s freedom to discuss candidates and is-\\nsues.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 21. As a result, the Court\\nfocused on the effect of the contribution limits on the\\nfreedom of political association and applied a lesser but\\nstill “rigorous standard of review.” Id., at 29. Under that\\nstandard, “[e]ven a ‘ “significant interference” with pro-\\ntected rights of political association’ may be sustained if\\nthe State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest\\nand employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary\\nabridgement of associational freedoms.” Id., at 25 (quot-\\ning Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U. S. 477, 488 (1975)).\\n   The primary purpose of FECA was to limit quid pro quo\\ncorruption and its appearance; that purpose satisfied the\\nrequirement of a “sufficiently important” governmental\\ninterest. 424 U. S., at 26–27. As for the “closely drawn”\\ncomponent, Buckley concluded that the $1,000 base limit\\n“focuses precisely on the problem of large campaign con-\\ntributions . . . while leaving persons free to engage in\\nindependent political expression, to associate actively\\nthrough volunteering their services, and to assist to a\\nlimited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting\\ncandidates and committees with financial resources.” Id.,\\nat 28. The Court therefore upheld the $1,000 base limit\\nunder the “closely drawn” test. Id., at 29.\\n   The Court next separately considered an overbreadth\\nchallenge to the base limit. See id., at 29–30. The chal-\\nlengers argued that the base limit was fatally overbroad\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\\n\\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nbecause most large donors do not seek improper influence\\nover legislators’ actions. Although the Court accepted that\\npremise, it nevertheless rejected the overbreadth chal-\\nlenge for two reasons: First, it was too “difficult to isolate\\nsuspect contributions” based on a contributor’s subjective\\nintent. Id., at 30. Second, “Congress was justified in\\nconcluding that the interest in safeguarding against the\\nappearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity\\nfor abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary\\ncontributions be eliminated.” Ibid.\\n  Finally, in one paragraph of its 139-page opinion, the\\nCourt turned to the $25,000 aggregate limit under FECA.\\nAs a preliminary matter, it noted that the constitution-\\nality of the aggregate limit “ha[d] not been separately\\naddressed at length by the parties.” Id., at 38. Then, in\\nthree sentences, the Court disposed of any constitutional\\nobjections to the aggregate limit that the challengers\\nmight have had:\\n    “The overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate\\n    restriction upon the number of candidates and com-\\n    mittees with which an individual may associate him-\\n    self by means of financial support. But this quite\\n    modest restraint upon protected political activity\\n    serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution\\n    limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute\\n    massive amounts of money to a particular candidate\\n    through the use of unearmarked contributions to po-\\n    litical committees likely to contribute to that candi-\\n    date, or huge contributions to the candidate’s political\\n    party. The limited, additional restriction on associa-\\n    tional freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus\\n    no more than a corollary of the basic individual con-\\n    tribution limitation that we have found to be constitu-\\n    tionally valid.” Ibid.\\n\\x0c10      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\n                              B\\n                              1\\n   The parties and amici curiae spend significant energy\\ndebating whether the line that Buckley drew between\\ncontributions and expenditures should remain the law.\\nNotwithstanding the robust debate, we see no need in this\\ncase to revisit Buckley’s distinction between contributions\\nand expenditures and the corollary distinction in the\\napplicable standards of review. Buckley held that the\\nGovernment’s interest in preventing quid pro quo corrup-\\ntion or its appearance was “sufficiently important,” id., at\\n26–27; we have elsewhere stated that the same interest\\nmay properly be labeled “compelling,” see National Con-\\nservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 496–497, so\\nthat the interest would satisfy even strict scrutiny. More-\\nover, regardless whether we apply strict scrutiny or Buck-\\nley’s “closely drawn” test, we must assess the fit between\\nthe stated governmental objective and the means selected\\nto achieve that objective. See, e.g., National Conservative\\nPolitical Action Comm., supra, at 496–501; Randall v.\\nSorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 253–262 (2006) (opinion of BREYER,\\nJ.). Or to put it another way, if a law that restricts politi-\\ncal speech does not “avoid unnecessary abridgement” of\\nFirst Amendment rights, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 25, it\\ncannot survive “rigorous” review.\\n   Because we find a substantial mismatch between the\\nGovernment’s stated objective and the means selected to\\nachieve it, the aggregate limits fail even under the “closely\\ndrawn” test. We therefore need not parse the differences\\nbetween the two standards in this case.\\n                            2\\n  Buckley treated the constitutionality of the $25,000\\naggregate limit as contingent upon that limit’s ability to\\nprevent circumvention of the $1,000 base limit, describing\\nthe aggregate limit as “no more than a corollary” of the\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nbase limit. Id., at 38. The Court determined that circum-\\nvention could occur when an individual legally contributes\\n“massive amounts of money to a particular candidate\\nthrough the use of unearmarked contributions” to entities\\nthat are themselves likely to contribute to the candidate.\\nIbid. For that reason, the Court upheld the $25,000 ag-\\ngregate limit.\\n   Although Buckley provides some guidance, we think\\nthat its ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of\\nthe aggregate limit in place under FECA does not control\\nhere. Buckley spent a total of three sentences analyzing\\nthat limit; in fact, the opinion pointed out that the consti-\\ntutionality of the aggregate limit “ha[d] not been separately\\naddressed at length by the parties.” Ibid. We are now\\nasked to address appellants’ direct challenge to the aggre-\\ngate limits in place under BCRA. BCRA is a different\\nstatutory regime, and the aggregate limits it imposes\\noperate against a distinct legal backdrop.\\n   Most notably, statutory safeguards against circumven-\\ntion have been considerably strengthened since Buckley\\nwas decided, through both statutory additions and the\\nintroduction of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. With\\nmore targeted anticircumvention measures in place today,\\nthe indiscriminate aggregate limits under BCRA appear\\nparticularly heavy-handed.\\n   The 1976 FECA Amendments, for example, added an-\\nother layer of base contribution limits. The 1974 version\\nof FECA had already capped contributions from political\\ncommittees to candidates, but the 1976 version added\\nlimits on contributions to political committees. This\\nchange was enacted at least “in part to prevent circumven-\\ntion of the very limitations on contributions that this\\nCourt upheld in Buckley.” California Medical Assn. v.\\nFederal Election Comm’n, 453 U. S. 182, 197–198 (1981)\\n(plurality opinion); see also id., at 203 (Blackmun, J.,\\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because\\n\\x0c12      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\na donor’s contributions to a political committee are now\\nlimited, a donor cannot flood the committee with “huge”\\namounts of money so that each contribution the committee\\nmakes is perceived as a contribution from him. Buckley,\\nsupra, at 38. Rather, the donor may contribute only\\n$5,000 to the committee, which hardly raises the specter of\\nabuse that concerned the Court in Buckley. Limits on\\ncontributions to political committees consequently create\\nan additional hurdle for a donor who seeks both to channel\\na large amount of money to a particular candidate and to\\nensure that he gets the credit for doing so.\\n   The 1976 Amendments also added an antiprolifera-\\ntion rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling\\nmultiple affiliated political committees. See 2 U. S. C.\\n§441a(a)(5); 11 CFR §100.5(g)(4). The Government ac-\\nknowledges that this antiproliferation rule “forecloses\\nwhat would otherwise be a particularly easy and effective\\nmeans of circumventing the limits on contributions to any\\nparticular political committee.” Brief for Appellee 46. In\\neffect, the rule eliminates a donor’s ability to create and\\nuse his own political committees to direct funds in excess\\nof the individual base limits. It thus blocks a straightfor-\\nward method of achieving the circumvention that was the\\nunderlying concern in Buckley.\\n   The intricate regulatory scheme that the Federal Elec-\\ntion Commission has enacted since Buckley further limits\\nthe opportunities for circumvention of the base limits via\\n“unearmarked contributions to political committees likely\\nto contribute” to a particular candidate. 424 U. S., at 38.\\nAlthough the earmarking provision, 2 U. S. C. §441a(a)(8),\\nwas in place when Buckley was decided, the FEC has since\\nadded regulations that define earmarking broadly. For\\nexample, the regulations construe earmarking to include\\nany designation, “whether direct or indirect, express or\\nimplied, oral or written.” 11 CFR §110.6(b)(1). The regu-\\nlations specify that an individual who has contributed to a\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\\n\\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nparticular candidate may not also contribute to a single-\\ncandidate committee for that candidate. §110.1(h)(1). Nor\\nmay an individual who has contributed to a candidate also\\ncontribute to a political committee that has supported or\\nanticipates supporting the same candidate, if the individ-\\nual knows that “a substantial portion [of his contribution]\\nwill be contributed to, or expended on behalf of,” that\\ncandidate. §110.1(h)(2).\\n  In addition to accounting for statutory and regulatory\\nchanges in the campaign finance arena, appellants’ chal-\\nlenge raises distinct legal arguments that Buckley did not\\nconsider. For example, presumably because of its cursory\\ntreatment of the $25,000 aggregate limit, Buckley did not\\nseparately address an overbreadth challenge with respect\\nto that provision. The Court rejected such a challenge to\\nthe base limits because of the difficulty of isolating suspect\\ncontributions. The propriety of large contributions to in-\\ndividual candidates turned on the subjective intent of\\ndonors, and the Court concluded that there was no way to\\ntell which donors sought improper influence over legisla-\\ntors’ actions. See 424 U. S., at 30. The aggregate limit, on\\nthe other hand, was upheld as an anticircumvention\\nmeasure, without considering whether it was possible to\\ndiscern which donations might be used to circumvent the\\nbase limits. See id., at 38. The Court never addressed\\noverbreadth in the specific context of aggregate limits,\\nwhere such an argument has far more force.\\n  Given the foregoing, this case cannot be resolved merely\\nby pointing to three sentences in Buckley that were writ-\\nten without the benefit of full briefing or argument on the\\nissue. See Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co., 314 U. S. 118,\\n139–140 (1941) (departing from “[l]oose language and a\\nsporadic, ill-considered decision” when asked to resolve\\na question “with our eyes wide open and in the light of\\nfull consideration”); Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236,\\n251 (1998) (departing from a prior decision where it\\n\\x0c14       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                      Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\n“was rendered without full briefing or argument”). We\\nare confronted with a different statute and different\\nlegal arguments, at a different point in the development\\nof campaign finance regulation.          Appellants’ sub-\\nstantial First Amendment challenge to the system of\\naggregate limits currently in place thus merits our plenary\\nconsideration.4\\n                             III\\n   The First Amendment “is designed and intended to\\nremove governmental restraints from the arena of public\\ndiscussion, putting the decision as to what views shall be\\nvoiced largely into the hands of each of us, . . . in the belief\\nthat no other approach would comport with the premise of\\nindividual dignity and choice upon which our political\\nsystem rests.” Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 24\\n(1971). As relevant here, the First Amendment safe-\\nguards an individual’s right to participate in the public\\ndebate through political expression and political associa-\\ntion. See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 15. When an individual\\ncontributes money to a candidate, he exercises both of\\nthose rights: The contribution “serves as a general expres-\\nsion of support for the candidate and his views” and\\n“serves to affiliate a person with a candidate.” Id., at\\n21–22.\\n   Those First Amendment rights are important regardless\\nwhether the individual is, on the one hand, a “lone pam-\\nphleteer[ ] or street corner orator[ ] in the Tom Paine\\nmold,” or is, on the other, someone who spends “substan-\\n——————\\n  4 The dissent contends that we should remand for development of an\\n\\nevidentiary record before answering the question with which we were\\npresented.

Either\\nway, he is participating in an electoral debate that we\\nhave recognized is “integral to the operation of the system\\nof government established by our Constitution.” Buckley,\\nsupra, at 14.\\n   Buckley acknowledged that aggregate limits at least\\ndiminish an individual’s right of political association. As\\nthe Court explained, the “overall $25,000 ceiling does\\nimpose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candi-\\ndates and committees with which an individual may asso-\\nciate himself by means of financial support.” 424 U. S., at\\n38. But the Court characterized that restriction as a\\n“quite modest restraint upon protected political activity.”\\nIbid. We cannot agree with that characterization. An\\naggregate limit on how many candidates and committees\\nan individual may support through contributions is not a\\n“modest restraint” at all. The Government may no more\\nrestrict how many candidates or causes a donor may\\nsupport than it may tell a newspaper how many candi-\\ndates it may endorse.\\n   To put it in the simplest terms, the aggregate limits\\nprohibit an individual from fully contributing to the pri-\\nmary and general election campaigns of ten or more can-\\ndidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits\\nCongress views as adequate to protect against corruption.\\nThe individual may give up to $5,200 each to nine candi-\\ndates, but the aggregate limits constitute an outright ban\\non further contributions to any other candidate (beyond\\nthe additional $1,800 that may be spent before reaching\\nthe $48,600 aggregate limit). At that point, the limits\\ndeny the individual all ability to exercise his expressive\\nand associational rights by contributing to someone who\\nwill advocate for his policy preferences. A donor must\\nlimit the number of candidates he supports, and may have\\n\\x0c16       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nto choose which of several policy concerns he will ad-\\nvance—clear First Amendment harms that the dissent\\nnever acknowledges.\\n   It is no answer to say that the individual can simply\\ncontribute less money to more people. To require one\\nperson to contribute at lower levels than others because he\\nwants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a\\nspecial burden on broader participation in the democratic\\nprocess. And as we have recently admonished, the Gov-\\nernment may not penalize an individual for “robustly\\nexercis[ing]” his First Amendment rights. Davis v. Federal\\nElection Comm’n, 554 U. S. 724, 739 (2008).\\n   The First Amendment burden is especially great for\\nindividuals who do not have ready access to alternative\\navenues for supporting their preferred politicians and\\npolicies. In the context of base contribution limits, Buck-\\nley observed that a supporter could vindicate his associa-\\ntional interests by personally volunteering his time and\\nenergy on behalf of a candidate. See 424 U. S., at 22, 28.\\nSuch personal volunteering is not a realistic alternative\\nfor those who wish to support a wide variety of candidates\\nor causes. Other effective methods of supporting preferred\\ncandidates or causes without contributing money are\\nreserved for a select few, such as entertainers capable of\\nraising hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single even-\\ning.

First, the dis-\\nsent’s “collective speech” reflected in laws is of course the\\nwill of the majority, and plainly can include laws that\\nrestrict free speech. The whole point of the First Amend-\\nment is to afford individuals protection against such in-\\nfringements. The First Amendment does not protect\\nthe government, even when the government purports to\\nact through legislation reflecting “collective speech.” Cf.\\nUnited States v. Alvarez, 567 U. S. ___ (2012); Wooley v.\\nMaynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977); West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.\\nBarnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943).\\n   Second, the degree to which speech is protected cannot\\nturn on a legislative or judicial determination that partic-\\nular speech is useful to the democratic process. The First\\nAmendment does not contemplate such “ad hoc balancing\\nof relative social costs and benefits.” United States v.\\nStevens, 559 U. S. 460, 470 (2010); see also United States\\nv.

Under that\\naccepted analysis, such restrictions are measured against\\nthe asserted public interest (usually framed as an im-\\nportant or compelling governmental interest). As ex-\\nplained below, we do not doubt the compelling nature of\\nthe “collective” interest in preventing corruption in the\\nelectoral process. But we permit Congress to pursue that\\n\\x0c18      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

This Court has identified only\\none legitimate governmental interest for restricting cam-\\npaign finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of\\ncorruption. See Davis, supra, at 741; National Conserva-\\ntive Political Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 496–497. We\\nhave consistently rejected attempts to suppress campaign\\nspeech based on other legislative objectives. No matter\\nhow desirable it may seem, it is not an acceptable govern-\\nmental objective to “level the playing field,” or to “level\\nelectoral opportunities,” or to “equaliz[e] the financial\\nresources of candidates.” Bennett, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip\\nop., at 22–23); Davis, supra, at 741–742; Buckley, supra, at\\n56. The First Amendment prohibits such legislative at-\\ntempts to “fine-tun[e]” the electoral process, no matter\\nhow well intentioned. Bennett, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\\nat 21).\\n    As we framed the relevant principle in Buckley, “the\\nconcept that government may restrict the speech of some\\nelements of our society in order to enhance the relative\\nvoice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.”\\n424 U. S., at 48–49. The dissent’s suggestion that Buckley\\nsupports the opposite proposition, see post, at 6, simply\\nignores what Buckley actually said on the matter. See\\nalso Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair\\nHousing v. Berkeley, 454 U.

As\\nBuckley explained, Congress may permissibly seek to rein\\nin “large contributions [that] are given to secure a political\\nquid pro quo from current and potential office holders.”\\n424 U. S., at 26. In addition to “actual quid pro quo\\narrangements,” Congress may permissibly limit “the ap-\\npearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of\\nthe opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large\\nindividual financial contributions” to particular candi-\\ndates. Id., at 27; see also Citizens United, 558 U.

Nor does the possi-\\nbility that an individual who spends large sums may\\ngarner “influence over or access to” elected officials or\\npolitical parties. Id., at 359; see McConnell v. Federal\\nElection Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 297 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,\\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\\nAnd because the Government’s interest in preventing the\\nappearance of corruption is equally confined to the ap-\\npearance of quid pro quo corruption, the Government may\\nnot seek to limit the appearance of mere influence or\\naccess. See Citizens United, 558 U.

The definition of corruption that we\\napply today, however, has firm roots in Buckley itself. The\\nCourt in that case upheld base contribution limits because\\nthey targeted “the danger of actual quid pro quo arrange-\\nments” and “the impact of the appearance of corruption\\nstemming from public awareness” of such a system of\\nunchecked direct contributions. 424 U. S., at 27. Buckley\\nsimultaneously rejected limits on spending that was less\\nlikely to “be given as a quid pro quo for improper commit-\\nments from the candidate.” Id., at 47. In any event, this\\ncase is not the first in which the debate over the proper\\nbreadth of the Government’s anticorruption interest has\\nbeen engaged. Compare Citizens United, 558 U. S., at\\n356–361 (majority opinion), with id., at 447–460 (opinion\\nof Stevens, J.).\\n   The line between quid pro quo corruption and general\\ninfluence may seem vague at times, but the distinction\\nmust be respected in order to safeguard basic First\\nAmendment rights. In addition, “[i]n drawing that line,\\nthe First Amendment requires us to err on the side of\\nprotecting political speech rather than suppressing it.”\\nFederal Election Comm’n v.

And if there is no risk that addi-\\ntional candidates will be corrupted by donations of up to\\n$5,200, then the Government must defend the aggregate\\nlimits by demonstrating that they prevent circumvention\\nof the base limits.\\n   The problem is that they do not serve that function in\\nany meaningful way. In light of the various statutes\\nand regulations currently in effect, Buckley’s fear that an\\nindividual might “contribute massive amounts of money to\\na particular candidate through the use of unearmarked\\ncontributions” to entities likely to support the candi-\\ndate, 424 U. S., at 38, is far too speculative. And—\\nimportantly—we “have never accepted mere conjecture as\\nadequate to carry a First Amendment burden.” Nixon v.\\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 392\\n(2000).\\n   As an initial matter, there is not the same risk of quid\\npro quo corruption or its appearance when money flows\\nthrough independent actors to a candidate, as when a\\ndonor contributes to a candidate directly. When an indi-\\nvidual contributes to a candidate, a party committee, or a\\nPAC, the individual must by law cede control over the\\nfunds. See 2 U. S. C. §441a(a)(8); 11 CFR §110.6. The\\nGovernment admits that if the funds are subsequently re-\\nrouted to a particular candidate, such action occurs at the\\ninitial recipient’s discretion—not the donor’s. See Brief for\\nAppellee 37. As a consequence, the chain of attribution\\ngrows longer, and any credit must be shared among the\\nvarious actors along the way. For those reasons, the risk\\nof quid pro quo corruption is generally applicable only to\\n“the narrow category of money gifts that are directed, in\\nsome manner, to a candidate or officeholder.” McConnell,\\n540 U. S., at 310 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\\n   Buckley nonetheless focused on the possibility that\\n“unearmarked contributions” could eventually find their\\nway to a candidate’s coffers. 424 U.

J.\\n\\ncepting the validity of Buckley’s circumvention theory, it is\\nhard to see how a candidate today could receive a “massive\\namount[ ] of money” that could be traced back to a particu-\\nlar contributor uninhibited by the aggregate limits. Ibid.\\nThe Government offers a series of scenarios in support of\\nthat possibility. But each is sufficiently implausible that\\nthe Government has not carried its burden of demonstrat-\\ning that the aggregate limits further its anticircumvention\\ninterest.\\n   The primary example of circumvention, in one form or\\nanother, envisions an individual donor who contributes\\nthe maximum amount under the base limits to a particu-\\nlar candidate, say, Representative Smith. Then the donor\\nalso channels “massive amounts of money” to Smith\\nthrough a series of contributions to PACs that have stated\\ntheir intention to support Smith. See, e.g., Brief for Appel-\\nlee 35–37; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 6.\\n   Various earmarking and antiproliferation rules disarm\\nthis example. Importantly, the donor may not contribute\\nto the most obvious PACs: those that support only Smith.\\nSee 11 CFR §110.1(h)(1); see also §102.14(a). Nor may the\\ndonor contribute to the slightly less obvious PACs that he\\nknows will route “a substantial portion” of his contribution\\nto Smith. §110.1(h)(2).\\n   The donor must instead turn to other PACs that are\\nlikely to give to Smith. When he does so, however, he\\ndiscovers that his contribution will be significantly diluted\\nby all the contributions from others to the same PACs.\\nAfter all, the donor cannot give more than $5,000 to a PAC\\nand so cannot dominate the PAC’s total receipts, as he\\ncould when Buckley was decided. 2 U. S. C. §441a(a)(1)(C).\\nHe cannot retain control over his contribution,\\n11 CFR §110.1(h)(3), direct his money “in any way” to Smith,\\n2 U. S.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\ndiminished, and with it the potential for corruption.\\n   It is not clear how many candidates a PAC must support\\nbefore our dedicated donor can avoid being tagged with\\nthe impermissible knowledge that “a substantial portion”\\nof his contribution will go to Smith. But imagine that the\\ndonor is one of ten equal donors to a PAC that gives the\\nhighest possible contribution to Smith.8 The PAC may\\ngive no more than $2,600 per election to Smith. Of that\\nsum, just $260 will be attributable to the donor intent on\\ncircumventing the base limits. Thus far he has hardly\\nsucceeded in funneling “massive amounts of money” to\\nSmith. Buckley, supra, at 38.\\n   But what if this donor does the same thing via, say, 100\\ndifferent PACs? His $260 contribution will balloon to\\n$26,000, ten times what he may contribute directly to\\nSmith in any given election.\\n   This 100-PAC scenario is highly implausible. In the\\nfirst instance, it is not true that the individual donor will\\nnecessarily have access to a sufficient number of PACs to\\neffectuate such a scheme. There are many PACs, but they\\nare not limitless. For the 2012 election cycle, the FEC\\nreported about 2,700 nonconnected PACs (excluding PACs\\nthat finance independent expenditures only). And not\\nevery PAC that supports Smith will work in this scheme:\\nFor our donor’s pro rata share of a PAC’s contribution to\\nSmith to remain meaningful, the PAC must be funded by\\nonly a small handful of donors. The antiproliferation\\nrules, which were not in effect when Buckley was decided,\\nprohibit our donor from creating 100 pro-Smith PACs of\\nhis own, or collaborating with the nine other donors to do\\n——————\\n  8 Even those premises are generous because they assume that the\\n\\ndonor contributes to non-multicandidate PACs, which are relatively\\nrare. Multicandidate PACs, by contrast, must have more than 50\\ncontributors. 11 CFR §100.5(e)(3). The more contributors, of course,\\nthe more the donor’s share in any eventual contribution to Smith is\\ndiluted.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

C. §441a(a)(5) (“all contributions made by\\npolitical committees established or financed or maintained\\nor controlled by . . . any other person, or by any group of\\nsuch persons, shall be considered to have been made by a\\nsingle political committee”).\\n   Moreover, if 100 PACs were to contribute to Smith and\\nfew other candidates, and if specific individuals like our\\nardent Smith supporter were to contribute to each, the\\nFEC could weigh those “circumstantial factors” to deter-\\nmine whether to deem the PACs affiliated. 11 CFR\\n§100.5(g)(4)(ii). The FEC’s analysis could take account\\nof a “common or overlapping membership” and “similar\\npatterns of contributions or contributors,” among other\\nconsiderations. §§100.5(g)(4)(ii)(D), (J). The FEC has in\\nthe past initiated enforcement proceedings against con-\\ntributors with such suspicious patterns of PAC donations.\\nSee, e.g., Conciliation Agreement, In re Riley, Matters\\nUnder Review 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (FEC, Dec. 19,\\n2001).\\n   On a more basic level, it is hard to believe that a rational\\nactor would engage in such machinations. In the example\\ndescribed, a dedicated donor spent $500,000—donating\\nthe full $5,000 to 100 different PACs—to add just $26,000\\nto Smith’s campaign coffers. That same donor, mean-\\nwhile, could have spent unlimited funds on independent\\nexpenditures on behalf of Smith. See Buckley, 424 U. S.,\\nat 44–51. Indeed, he could have spent his entire $500,000\\nadvocating for Smith, without the risk that his selected\\nPACs would choose not to give to Smith, or that he would\\nhave to share credit with other contributors to the PACs.\\n   We have said in the context of independent expenditures\\nthat “ ‘[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination of\\nan expenditure with the candidate or his agent . . . un-\\ndermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate.’ ”\\nCitizens United, 558 U. S., at 357 (quoting Buckley, supra,\\nat 47). But probably not by 95 percent. And at least from\\n\\x0c26        MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nthe donor’s point of view, it strikes us as far more likely\\nthat he will want to see his full $500,000 spent on behalf\\nof his favored candidate—even if it must be spent inde-\\npendently—rather than see it diluted to a small fraction so\\nthat it can be contributed directly by someone else.9\\n  Another circumvention example is the one that appar-\\nently motivated the District Court. As the District Court\\ncrafted the example, a donor gives a $500,000 check to\\na joint fundraising committee composed of a candidate, a\\nnational party committee, and “most of the party’s state\\nparty committees” (actually, 47 of the 50). 893 F. Supp.\\n2d, at 140. The committees divide up the money so that\\neach one receives the maximum contribution permissible\\nunder the base limits, but then each transfers its allocated\\nportion to the same single committee. That committee\\nuses the money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a\\nparticular candidate. If that scenario “seem[s] unlikely,”\\nthe District Court thought so, too. Ibid. But because the\\nDistrict Court could “imagine” that chain of events, it held\\nthat the example substantiated the Government’s circum-\\nvention concerns. Ibid.\\n  One problem, however, is that the District Court’s spec-\\nulation relies on illegal earmarking. Lest there be any\\nconfusion, a joint fundraising committee is simply a mech-\\nanism for individual committees to raise funds collectively,\\nnot to circumvent base limits or earmarking rules. See 11\\n——————\\n  9 The  Justice Department agrees. As Acting Assistant Attorney Gen-\\neral Mythili Raman recently testified before Congress: “We anticipate\\nseeing fewer cases of conduit contributions directly to campaign com-\\nmittees or parties, because individuals or corporations who wish to\\ninfluence elections or officials will no longer need to attempt to do so\\nthrough conduit contribution schemes that can be criminally prosecut-\\ned. Instead, they are likely to simply make unlimited contributions to\\nSuper PACs or 501(c)s.” Hearing on Current Issues in Campaign\\nFinance Law Enforcement before the Subcommittee on Crime and\\nTerrorism of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 113th Cong., 1st\\nSess., 3 (2013).\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U.

Under no circumstances may a contri-\\nbution to a joint fundraising committee result in an alloca-\\ntion that exceeds the contribution limits applicable to\\nits constituent parts; the committee is in fact required\\nto return any excess funds to the contributor. See\\n§102.17(c)(6)(i).\\n   The District Court assumed compliance with the specific\\nallocation rules governing joint fundraising committees,\\nbut it expressly based its example on the premise that the\\ndonor would telegraph his desire to support one candidate\\nand that “many separate entities would willingly serve as\\nconduits for a single contributor’s interests.” 893 F. Supp.\\n2d, at 140. Regardless whether so many distinct entities\\nwould cooperate as a practical matter, the earmarking\\nprovision prohibits an individual from directing funds\\n“through an intermediary or conduit” to a particular can-\\ndidate. 2 U. S. C. §441a(8). Even the “implicit[ ]” agree-\\nment imagined by the District Court, 893 F. Supp. 2d, at\\n140, would trigger the earmarking provision. See 11 CFR\\n§110.6(b)(1). So this circumvention scenario could not\\nsucceed without assuming that nearly 50 separate party\\ncommittees would engage in a transparent violation of the\\nearmarking rules (and that they would not be caught if\\nthey did).\\n   Moreover, the District Court failed to acknowledge that\\nits $500,000 example cannot apply to most candidates. It\\ncrafted the example around a presidential candidate, for\\nwhom donations in the thousands of dollars may not seem\\nremarkable—especially in comparison to the nearly $1.4\\nbillion spent by the 2012 presidential candidates. The\\nsame example cannot, however, be extrapolated to most\\nHouse and Senate candidates.

It might be that such\\nguilty knowledge could not be shown because the donors\\nwere not guilty—a possibility that the dissent does not\\nentertain. In any event, the donors described in those\\neight cases were typically alleged to have exceeded the\\nbase limits by $5,000 or less. The FEC’s failure to find the\\nrequisite knowledge in those cases hardly means that the\\nagency will be equally powerless to prevent a scheme in\\nwhich a donor routes millions of dollars in excess of the\\nbase limits to a particular candidate, as in the dissent’s\\n“Example Two.” And if an FEC official cannot establish\\nknowledge of circumvention (or establish affiliation) when\\nthe same ten donors contribute $10,000 each to 200 newly\\ncreated PACs, and each PAC writes a $10,000 check to the\\nsame ten candidates—the dissent’s “Example Three”—\\nthen that official has not a heart but a head of stone.

In particular, each national political party’s\\nspending ran in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The\\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), Na-\\ntional Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC),\\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), and\\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC),\\nhowever, spent less than $1 million each on direct candi-\\ndate contributions and less than $10 million each on coor-\\ndinated expenditures.

Including both coordinated\\nexpenditures and direct candidate contributions, the\\nNRSC and DSCC spent just 7% of their total funds on\\ncontributions to candidates and the NRCC and DCCC\\nspent just 3%.\\n   Likewise, as explained previously, state parties rarely\\ncontribute to candidates in other States. In the 2012\\nelection cycle, the Republican and Democratic state party\\ncommittees in all 50 States (and the District of Columbia)\\ncontributed a paltry $17,750 to House and Senate candi-\\ndates in other States.

S., at 357. The aggregate limits are then layered on\\ntop, ostensibly to prevent circumvention of the base limits.\\nThis “prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach” requires\\nthat we be particularly diligent in scrutinizing the law’s\\nfit. Wisconsin Right to Life, 551 U. S., at 479 (opinion of\\nROBERTS, C. J.); see McConnell, 540 U. S., at 268–269\\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.).\\n                              2\\n   Importantly, there are multiple alternatives available to\\nCongress that would serve the Government’s anticircum-\\nvention interest, while avoiding “unnecessary abridgment”\\nof First Amendment rights. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 25.\\n   The most obvious might involve targeted restrictions on\\ntransfers among candidates and political committees.\\nThere are currently no such limits on transfers among\\nparty committees and from candidates to party commit-\\ntees. See 2 U. S. C. §441a(a)(4); 11 CFR §113.2(c). Per-\\nhaps for that reason, a central concern of the District\\nCourt, the Government, multiple amici curiae, and the\\ndissent has been the ability of party committees to trans-\\nfer money freely. If Congress agrees that this is problem-\\natic, it might tighten its permissive transfer rules. Doing\\nso would impose a lesser burden on First Amendment\\nrights, as compared to aggregate limits that flatly ban\\ncontributions beyond certain levels. And while the Gov-\\nernment has not conceded that transfer restrictions would\\nbe a perfect substitute for the aggregate limits, it has\\nrecognized that they would mitigate the risk of circumven-\\ntion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.\\n   One possible option for restricting transfers would be to\\nrequire contributions above the current aggregate limits to\\nbe deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts\\n\\x0c34      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nand spent only by their recipients. Such a solution would\\naddress the same circumvention possibilities as the cur-\\nrent aggregate limits, while not completely barring contri-\\nbutions beyond the aggregate levels. In addition (or as an\\nalternative), if Congress believes that circumvention is\\nespecially likely to occur through creation of a joint fund-\\nraising committee, it could require that funds received\\nthrough those committees be spent by their recipients (or\\nperhaps it could simply limit the size of joint fundraising\\ncommittees). Such alternatives to the aggregate limits\\nproperly refocus the inquiry on the delinquent actor: the\\nrecipient of a contribution within the base limits, who then\\nroutes the money in a manner that undermines those\\nlimits. See Citizens United, supra, at 360–361; cf. Bart-\\nnicki v. Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 529–530 (2001).\\n   Indeed, Congress has adopted transfer restrictions, and\\nthe Court has upheld them, in the context of state party\\nspending. See 2 U. S. C. §441i(b). So-called “Levin funds”\\nare donations permissible under state law that may be\\nspent on certain federal election activity—namely, voter\\nregistration and identification, get-out-the-vote efforts, or\\ngeneric campaign activities. Levin funds are raised directly\\nby the state or local party committee that ultimately\\nspends them. §441i(b)(2)(B)(iv). That means that other\\nparty committees may not transfer Levin funds, solicit\\nLevin funds on behalf of the particular state or local com-\\nmittee, or engage in joint fundraising of Levin funds. See\\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 171–173. McConnell upheld\\nthose transfer restrictions as “justifiable anticircumven-\\ntion measures,” though it acknowledged that they posed\\nsome associational burdens. Id., at 171. Here, a narrow\\ntransfer restriction on contributions that could otherwise\\nbe recontributed in excess of the base limits could rely on a\\nsimilar justification.\\n   Other alternatives might focus on earmarking. Many of\\nthe scenarios that the Government and the dissent hy-\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           35\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\npothesize involve at least implicit agreements to circum-\\nvent the base limits—agreements that are already prohib-\\nited by the earmarking rules. See 11 CFR §110.6. The\\nFEC might strengthen those rules further by, for exam-\\nple, defining how many candidates a PAC must support\\nin order to ensure that “a substantial portion” of a do-\\nnor’s contribution is not rerouted to a certain candidate.\\n§110.1(h)(2). Congress might also consider a modified\\nversion of the aggregate limits, such as one that prohibits\\ndonors who have contributed the current maximum sums\\nfrom further contributing to political committees that have\\nindicated they will support candidates to whom the donor\\nhas already contributed. To be sure, the existing earmark-\\ning provision does not define “the outer limit of accept-\\nable tailoring.” Colorado Republican Federal Campaign\\nComm., 533 U. S., at 462. But tighter rules could have a\\nsignificant effect, especially when adopted in concert with\\nother measures.\\n   We do not mean to opine on the validity of any particu-\\nlar proposal. The point is that there are numerous al-\\nternative approaches available to Congress to prevent\\ncircumvention of the base limits.\\n                               D\\n   Finally, disclosure of contributions minimizes the poten-\\ntial for abuse of the campaign finance system. Disclosure\\nrequirements are in part “justified based on a governmen-\\ntal interest in ‘provid[ing] the electorate with information’\\nabout the sources of election-related spending.” Citizens\\nUnited, 558 U. S., at 367 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 66).\\nThey may also “deter actual corruption and avoid the\\nappearance of corruption by exposing large contributions\\nand expenditures to the light of publicity.” Id., at 67.\\nDisclosure requirements burden speech, but—unlike the\\naggregate limits—they do not impose a ceiling on speech.\\nCitizens United, supra, at 366; but see McConnell, supra,\\n\\x0c36        MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nat 275–277 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). For that reason,\\ndisclosure often represents a less restrictive alternative to\\nflat bans on certain types or quantities of speech. See,\\ne.g., Federal Election Comm’n v. Massachusetts Citizens\\nfor Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 262 (1986).\\n   With modern technology, disclosure now offers a partic-\\nularly effective means of arming the voting public with\\ninformation. In 1976, the Court observed that Congress\\ncould regard disclosure as “only a partial measure.” Buck-\\nley, 424 U. S., at 28. That perception was understandable\\nin a world in which information about campaign contribu-\\ntions was filed at FEC offices and was therefore virtually\\ninaccessible to the average member of the public. See\\nBrief for Cause of Action Institute as Amicus Curiae 15–\\n16. Today, given the Internet, disclosure offers much more\\nrobust protections against corruption. See Citizens United,\\nsupra, at 370–371. Reports and databases are availa-\\nble on the FEC’s Web site almost immediately after they\\nare filed, supplemented by private entities such as Open-\\nSecrets.org and FollowTheMoney.org. Because massive\\nquantities of information can be accessed at the click of a\\nmouse, disclosure is effective to a degree not possible at\\nthe time Buckley, or even McConnell, was decided.\\n   The existing aggregate limits may in fact encourage the\\nmovement of money away from entities subject to dis-\\nclosure. Because individuals’ direct contributions are\\nlimited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for\\npolitical speech. See Citizens United, supra, at 364. Indi-\\nviduals can, for example, contribute unlimited amounts to\\n501(c) organizations, which are not required to publicly\\ndisclose their donors. See 26 U. S. C. §6104(d)(3). Such\\norganizations spent some $300 million on independent\\nexpenditures in the 2012 election cycle.\\n                              V\\n     At oral argument, the Government shifted its focus from\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           37\\n\\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nBuckley’s anticircumvention rationale to an argument that\\nthe aggregate limits deter corruption regardless of their\\nability to prevent circumvention of the base limits. See Tr.\\nof Oral Arg. 29–30, 50–52. The Government argued that\\nthere is an opportunity for corruption whenever a large\\ncheck is given to a legislator, even if the check consists of\\ncontributions within the base limits to be appropriately\\ndivided among numerous candidates and committees. The\\naggregate limits, the argument goes, ensure that the check\\namount does not become too large. That new rationale for\\nthe aggregate limits—embraced by the dissent, see post, at\\n15–17—does not wash. It dangerously broadens the cir-\\ncumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articu-\\nlated in our prior cases, and targets as corruption the\\ngeneral, broad-based support of a political party.\\n  In analyzing the base limits, Buckley made clear that\\nthe risk of corruption arises when an individual makes\\nlarge contributions to the candidate or officeholder him-\\nself. See 424 U. S., at 26–27. Buckley’s analysis of the\\naggregate limit under FECA was similarly confined. The\\nCourt noted that the aggregate limit guarded against an\\nindividual’s funneling—through circumvention—“massive\\namounts of money to a particular candidate.” Id., at 38\\n(emphasis added). We have reiterated that understanding\\nseveral times. See, e.g., National Conservative Political\\nAction Comm., 470 U. S., at 497 (quid pro quo corruption\\noccurs when “[e]lected officials are influenced to act con-\\ntrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of finan-\\ncial gain to themselves or infusions of money into their\\ncampaigns” (emphasis added)); Citizens Against Rent\\nControl/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S.\\n290, 297 (1981) (Buckley’s holding that contribution limits\\nare permissible “relates to the perception of undue influ-\\nence of large contributors to a candidate”); McConnell, 540\\nU. S., at 296 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (quid pro quo cor-\\nruption in Buckley involved “contributions that flowed to a\\n\\x0c38      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\\n\\nparticular candidate’s benefit” (emphasis added)).\\n   Of course a candidate would be pleased with a donor\\nwho contributed not only to the candidate himself, but also\\nto other candidates from the same party, to party commit-\\ntees, and to PACs supporting the party. But there is a\\nclear, administrable line between money beyond the base\\nlimits funneled in an identifiable way to a candidate—for\\nwhich the candidate feels obligated—and money within\\nthe base limits given widely to a candidate’s party—for\\nwhich the candidate, like all other members of the party,\\nfeels grateful.\\n   When donors furnish widely distributed support within\\nall applicable base limits, all members of the party or\\nsupporters of the cause may benefit, and the leaders of the\\nparty or cause may feel particular gratitude. That grati-\\ntude stems from the basic nature of the party system, in\\nwhich party members join together to further common\\npolitical beliefs, and citizens can choose to support a party\\nbecause they share some, most, or all of those beliefs. See\\nTashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 214–\\n216 (1986). To recast such shared interest, standing\\nalone, as an opportunity for quid pro quo corruption would\\ndramatically expand government regulation of the politi-\\ncal process. Cf. California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530\\nU. S. 567, 572–573 (2000) (recognizing the Government’s\\n“role to play in structuring and monitoring the election\\nprocess,” but rejecting “the proposition that party affairs\\nare public affairs, free of First Amendment protections”).\\n   The Government suggests that it is the solicitation of\\nlarge contributions that poses the danger of corruption,\\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30, 38–39, 50–51; see also post, at\\n15–16, 20, but the aggregate limits are not limited to any\\ndirect solicitation by an officeholder or candidate. Cf.\\nMcConnell, supra, at 298–299, 308 (opinion of KENNEDY,\\nJ.)

For our purposes here, it is\\nenough that the aggregate limits at issue are not directed\\nspecifically to candidate behavior.\\n                        *     *    *\\n  For the past 40 years, our campaign finance jurispru-\\ndence has focused on the need to preserve authority for\\nthe Government to combat corruption, without at the\\nsame time compromising the political responsiveness at\\nthe heart of the democratic process, or allowing the Gov-\\nernment to favor some participants in that process over\\nothers. As Edmund Burke explained in his famous speech\\nto the electors of Bristol, a representative owes constitu-\\nents the exercise of his “mature judgment,” but judgment\\ninformed by “the strictest union, the closest correspond-\\nence, and the most unreserved communication with his\\nconstituents.” The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund\\nBurke 129–130 (J. Burke ed. 1867). Constituents have the\\nright to support candidates who share their views and\\nconcerns. Representatives are not to follow constituent\\norders, but can be expected to be cognizant of and respon-\\nsive to those concerns. Such responsiveness is key to the\\nvery concept of self-governance through elected officials.\\n  The Government has a strong interest, no less critical to\\nour democratic system, in combatting corruption and its\\nappearance. We have, however, held that this interest\\nmust be limited to a specific kind of corruption—quid pro\\nquo corruption—in order to ensure that the Government’s\\nefforts do not have the effect of restricting the First\\nAmendment right of citizens to choose who shall govern\\nthem. For the reasons set forth, we conclude that the\\n\\x0c40      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

Contributions to political campaigns, no less\\nthan direct expenditures, “generate essential political\\nspeech” by fostering discussion of public issues and can-\\ndidate qualifications. Shrink Missouri, supra, at 412\\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also id., at 410–411. Buckley\\nitself recognized that both contribution and expenditure\\n\\x0c2       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\\n\\nlimits “operate in an area of the most fundamental First\\nAmendment activities” and “implicate fundamental First\\nAmendment interests.” 424 U. S., at 14, 23. But instead\\nof treating political giving and political spending alike,\\nBuckley distinguished the two, embracing a bifurcated\\nstandard of review under which contribution limits receive\\nless rigorous scrutiny. Id., at 25.\\n   As I have explained before, “[t]he analytic foundation of\\nBuckley . . . was tenuous from the very beginning and has\\nonly continued to erode in the intervening years.” Shrink\\nMissouri, supra, at 412 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). To\\njustify a lesser standard of review for contribution limits,\\nBuckley relied on the premise that contributions are dif-\\nferent in kind from direct expenditures. None of the\\nCourt’s bases for that premise withstands careful review.\\nThe linchpin of the Court’s analysis was its assertion that\\n“[w]hile contributions may result in political expression if\\nspent by a candidate or an association to present views to\\nthe voters, the transformation of contributions into politi-\\ncal debate involves speech by someone other than the\\ncontributor.” 424 U. S., at 21. But that “ ‘speech by\\nproxy’ ” rationale quickly breaks down, given that “[e]ven\\nin the case of a direct expenditure, there is usually some\\ngo-between that facilitates the dissemination of the\\nspender’s message—for instance, an advertising agency or\\na television station.” Colorado I, supra, at 638–639 (opin-\\nion of THOMAS, J.). Moreover, we have since rejected the\\n“ ‘proxy speech’ ” approach as affording insufficient First\\nAmendment protection to “the voices of those of modest\\nmeans as opposed to those sufficiently wealthy to be able\\nto buy expensive media ads with their own resources.”\\nFederal Election Comm’n v. National Conservative Politi-\\ncal Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 495 (1985); see Shrink\\nMissouri, supra, at 413–414 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\\n   The remaining justifications Buckley provided are also\\nflawed. For example, Buckley claimed that contribution\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 20,\\n21. But this Court has never required a speaker to explain\\nthe reasons for his position in order to obtain full First\\nAmendment protection. Instead, we have consistently\\nheld that speech is protected even “when the underlying\\nbasis for a position is not given.” Shrink Missouri, supra,\\nat 415, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see, e.g., City of\\nLadue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 46 (1994) (sign reading “For\\nPeace in the Gulf ”); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 415–\\n416 (1989) (flag burning); Tinker v.

(“Even a pure message of support, unadorned\\nwith reasons, is valuable to the democratic process”)\\n   Equally unpersuasive is Buckley’s suggestion that con-\\ntribution limits warrant less stringent review because\\n“[t]he quantity of communication by the contributor does\\nnot increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution,”\\nand “[a]t most, the size of the contribution provides a very\\nrough index of the intensity of the contributor’s support\\nfor the candidate.” 424 U. S., at 21. Contributions do in-\\ncrease the quantity of communication by “amplifying the\\nvoice of the candidate” and “help[ing] to ensure the dis-\\nsemination of the messages that the contributor wishes to\\nconvey.” Shrink Missouri, supra, at 415 (THOMAS, J.,\\ndissenting). They also serve as a quantifiable metric of\\nthe intensity of a particular contributor’s support, as\\ndemonstrated by the frequent practice of giving different\\namounts to different candidates. Buckley simply failed to\\nrecognize that “we have accorded full First Amendment\\nprotection to expressions of intensity.” Id., at 415, n. 3;\\nsee also Cohen v. California, 403 U.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\\n\\n(protecting the use of an obscenity for emphasis).\\n   Although today’s decision represents a faithful applica-\\ntion of our precedents, the plurality’s discussion of Buckley\\nomits any reference to these discarded rationales. In-\\nstead, the plurality alludes only to Buckley’s last remain-\\ning reason for devaluing political contributions relative to\\nexpenditures. See ante, at 8 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S.,\\nat 21). The relevant sentence from Buckley reads as\\nfollows:\\n    “A limitation on the amount of money a person may\\n    give to a candidate or campaign organization thus in-\\n    volves little direct restraint on his political commu-\\n    nication, for it permits the symbolic expression of\\n    support evidenced by a contribution but does not in\\n    any way infringe the contributor’s freedom to discuss\\n    candidates and issues.” Ibid.\\nThat proposition, read in full, cannot be squared with a\\nkey premise of today’s decision.\\n   Among the Government’s justifications for the aggregate\\nlimits set forth in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of\\n2002 (BCRA) is that “an individual can engage in the\\n‘symbolic act of contributing’ to as many entities as he\\nwishes.” Brief for Appellee 20. That is, the Government\\ncontends that aggregate limits are constitutional as long\\nas an individual can still contribute some token amount (a\\ndime, for example) to each of his preferred candidates.\\nThe plurality, quite correctly, rejects that argument,\\nnoting that “[i]t is no answer to say that the individual can\\nsimply contribute less money to more people.” Ante, at 16.\\nThat is so because “[t]o require one person to contribute at\\nlower levels than others because he wants to support more\\ncandidates or causes is to impose a special burden on\\nbroader participation in the democratic process.” Ibid.\\n   What the plurality does not recognize is that the same\\nlogic also defeats the reasoning from Buckley on which the\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\\n\\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\\n\\nplurality purports to rely. Under the plurality’s analysis,\\nlimiting the amount of money a person may give to a\\ncandidate does impose a direct restraint on his political\\ncommunication; if it did not, the aggregate limits at issue\\nhere would not create “a special burden on broader partic-\\nipation in the democratic process.” Ibid. I am wholly in\\nagreement with the plurality’s conclusion on this point:\\n“[T]he Government may not penalize an individual for\\n‘robustly exercis[ing]’ his First Amendment rights.” Ibid.\\n(quoting Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. 724,\\n739 (2008)). I regret only that the plurality does not\\nacknowledge that today’s decision, although purporting\\nnot to overrule Buckley, continues to chip away at its\\nfootings.\\n   In sum, what remains of Buckley is a rule without a\\nrationale. Contributions and expenditures are simply\\n“two sides of the same First Amendment coin,” and our ef-\\nforts to distinguish the two have produced mere “word\\ngames” rather than any cognizable principle of constitu-\\ntional law. Buckley, supra, at 241, 244 (Burger, C. J.,\\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). For that rea-\\nson, I would overrule Buckley and subject the aggregate\\nlimits in BCRA to strict scrutiny, which they would surely\\nfail. See Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 640–641 (opinion of\\nTHOMAS, J.) (“I am convinced that under traditional strict\\nscrutiny, broad prophylactic caps on both spending and\\ngiving in the political process . . . are unconstitutional”).\\n   This case represents yet another missed opportunity to\\nright the course of our campaign finance jurisprudence by\\nrestoring a standard that is faithful to the First Amend-\\nment. Until we undertake that reexamination, we remain\\nin a “halfway house” of our own design. Shrink Missouri,\\n528 U. S., at 410 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).

S. 1\\n(1976) (per curiam), this Court considered the constitu\\xad\\ntionality of laws that imposed limits upon the overall\\namount a single person can contribute to all federal candi\\xad\\ndates, political parties, and committees taken together.\\nThe Court held that those limits did not violate the Con\\xad\\nstitution. Id., at 38; accord, McConnell v. Federal Election\\nComm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 138, n. 40, 152–153, n. 48 (2003)\\n(citing with approval Buckley’s aggregate limits holding).\\n   The Buckley Court focused upon the same problem that\\nconcerns the Court today, and it wrote:\\n    “The overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate\\n    restriction upon the number of candidates and com\\xad\\n    mittees with which an individual may associate him\\xad\\n    self by means of financial support. But this quite\\n    modest restraint upon protected political activity\\n    serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution\\n    limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute\\n    massive amounts of money to a particular candidate\\n    through the use of unearmarked contributions to po\\xad\\n    litical committees likely to contribute to that candi\\xad\\n    date, or huge contributions to the candidate’s political\\n    party. The limited, additional restriction on associa\\xad\\n\\x0c2       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\n    tional freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus\\n    no more than a corollary of the basic individual con\\xad\\n    tribution limitation that we have found to be constitu\\xad\\n    tionally valid.” 424 U. S., at 38.\\n   Today a majority of the Court overrules this holding. It\\nis wrong to do so. Its conclusion rests upon its own, not a\\nrecord-based, view of the facts. Its legal analysis is faulty:\\nIt misconstrues the nature of the competing constitutional\\ninterests at stake. It understates the importance of pro\\xad\\ntecting the political integrity of our governmental insti-\\ntutions. It creates a loophole that will allow a single\\nindividual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party\\nor to a candidate’s campaign. Taken together with Citi-\\nzens United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. 310\\n(2010), today’s decision eviscerates our Nation’s campaign\\nfinance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with\\nthe grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those\\nlaws were intended to resolve.\\n                              I\\n   The plurality concludes that the aggregate contribution\\nlimits “ ‘unnecessar[ily] abridg[e]’ ” First Amendment\\nrights. Ante, at 8, 30 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 25). It\\nnotes that some individuals will wish to “spen[d] ‘substan\\xad\\ntial amounts of money in order to communicate [their]\\npolitical ideas through sophisticated’ means.” Ante, at 14–\\n15 (quoting Federal Election Comm’n v. National Con-\\nservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 493 (1985)\\n(NCPAC)). Aggregate contribution ceilings limit an indi\\xad\\nvidual’s ability to engage in such “broader participation in\\nthe democratic process,” while insufficiently advancing\\nany legitimate governmental objective. Ante, at 16, 21–29.\\nHence, the plurality finds, they violate the Constitution.\\n   The plurality’s conclusion rests upon three separate but\\nrelated claims. Each is fatally flawed. First, the plurality\\nsays that given the base limits on contributions to candi\\xad\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\ndates and political committees, aggregate limits do not\\nfurther any independent governmental objective worthy of\\nprotection. And that is because, given the base limits,\\n“[s]pending large sums of money in connection with elec\\xad\\ntions” does not “give rise to . . . corruption.” Ante, at 19.\\nIn making this argument, the plurality relies heavily upon\\na narrow definition of “corruption” that excludes efforts\\nto obtain “ ‘influence over or access to’ elected officials or\\npolitical parties. ” Ibid. (quoting Citizens United, supra, at\\n359); accord, ante, at 18–20, 22–29.\\n    Second, the plurality assesses the instrumental objec\\xad\\ntive of the aggregate limits, namely, safeguarding the base\\nlimits. It finds that they “do not serve that function in any\\nmeaningful way.” Ante, at 22. That is because, even\\nwithout the aggregate limits, the possibilities for circum\\xad\\nventing the base limits are “implausible” and “divorced\\nfrom reality.” Ante, at 23, 24, 28.\\n    Third, the plurality says the aggregate limits are not a\\n“ ‘reasonable’ ” policy tool. Rather, they are “poorly tailored\\nto the Government’s interest in preventing circumvention\\nof the base limits.” Ante, at 30 (quoting Board of Trustees\\nof State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989)).\\nThe plurality imagines several alternative regulations\\nthat it says might just as effectively thwart circumvention.\\nAccordingly, it finds, the aggregate caps are out of “ ‘pro\\xad\\nportion to the [anticorruption] interest served.’ ” Ante, at\\n30 (quoting Fox, supra, at 480).\\n                              II\\n  The plurality’s first claim—that large aggregate contri\\xad\\nbutions do not “give rise” to “corruption”—is plausible only\\nbecause the plurality defines “corruption” too narrowly.\\nThe plurality describes the constitutionally permissible\\nobjective of campaign finance regulation as follows: “Con\\xad\\ngress may target only a specific type of corruption—‘quid\\npro quo’ corruption.” Ante, at 19. It then defines quid pro\\n\\x0c4       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nquo corruption to mean no more than “a direct exchange of\\nan official act for money”—an act akin to bribery. Ante, at\\n2–3. It adds specifically that corruption does not include\\nefforts to “garner ‘influence over or access to’ elected offi\\xad\\ncials or political parties.” Ante, at 19 (quoting Citizens\\nUnited, supra, at 359). Moreover, the Government’s ef\\xad\\nforts to prevent the “appearance of corruption” are “equally\\nconfined to the appearance of quid pro quo corruption,”\\nas narrowly defined. Ante, at 19. In the plurality’s view, a\\nfederal statute could not prevent an individual from writ\\xad\\ning a million dollar check to a political party (by donating\\nto its various committees), because the rationale for any\\nlimit would “dangerously broade[n] the circumscribed\\ndefinition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in our\\nprior cases.” Ante, at 37.\\n  This critically important definition of “corruption” is\\ninconsistent with the Court’s prior case law (with the\\npossible exception of Citizens United, as I will explain\\nbelow). It is virtually impossible to reconcile with this\\nCourt’s decision in McConnell, upholding the Bipartisan\\nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA). And it misun-\\nderstands the constitutional importance of the interests\\nat stake.       In fact, constitutional interests—indeed,\\nFirst Amendment interests—lie on both sides of the legal\\nequation.\\n                             A\\n  In reality, as the history of campaign finance reform\\nshows and as our earlier cases on the subject have recog\\xad\\nnized, the anticorruption interest that drives Congress to\\nregulate campaign contributions is a far broader, more\\nimportant interest than the plurality acknowledges. It is\\nan interest in maintaining the integrity of our public\\ngovernmental institutions. And it is an interest rooted in\\nthe Constitution and in the First Amendment itself.\\n  Consider at least one reason why the First Amendment\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nprotects political speech. Speech does not exist in a vac-\\nuum. Rather, political communication seeks to secure\\ngovernment action. A politically oriented “marketplace of\\nideas” seeks to form a public opinion that can and will\\ninfluence elected representatives.\\n   This is not a new idea. Eighty-seven years ago, Justice\\nBrandeis wrote that the First Amendment’s protection of\\nspeech was “essential to effective democracy.” Whitney v.\\nCalifornia, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927) (concurring opinion).\\nChief Justice Hughes reiterated the same idea shortly\\nthereafter: “A fundamental principle of our constitutional\\nsystem” is the “maintenance of the opportunity for free\\npolitical discussion to the end that government may be\\nresponsive to the will of the people.” Stromberg v. Cali-\\nfornia, 283 U. S. 359, 369 (1931) (emphasis added). In\\nCitizens United, the Court stated that “[s]peech is an\\nessential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to\\nhold officials accountable to the people.” 558 U. S., at 339\\n(emphasis added).\\n   The Framers had good reason to emphasize this same\\nconnection between political speech and governmental\\naction. An influential 18th-century continental philoso\\xad\\npher had argued that in a representative democracy, the\\npeople lose control of their representatives between elec\\xad\\ntions, during which interim periods they were “in chains.”\\nJ. Rousseau, An Inquiry Into the Nature of the Social\\nContract 265–266 (transl. 1791).\\n   The Framers responded to this criticism both by requir\\xad\\ning frequent elections to federal office, and by enacting a\\nFirst Amendment that would facilitate a “chain of com\\xad\\nmunication between the people, and those, to whom they\\nhave committed the exercise of the powers of government.”\\nJ. Wilson, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United\\nStates of America 30–31 (1792). This “chain” would\\nestablish the necessary “communion of interests and\\nsympathy of sentiments” between the people and their\\n\\x0c6       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nrepresentatives, so that public opinion could be channeled\\ninto effective governmental action. The Federalist No. 57,\\np. 386 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison); accord, T. Benton,\\n1 Abridgement of the Debates of Congress, from 1789 to\\n1856, p. 141 (1857) (explaining that the First Amendment\\nwill strengthen American democracy by giving “ ‘the peo\\xad\\nple’ ” a right to “ ‘publicly address their representatives,’ ”\\n“ ‘privately advise them,’ ” or “ ‘declare their sentiments by\\npetition to the whole body’ ” (quoting James Madison)).\\nAccordingly, the First Amendment advances not only the\\nindividual’s right to engage in political speech, but also the\\npublic’s interest in preserving a democratic order in which\\ncollective speech matters.\\n   What has this to do with corruption? It has everything\\nto do with corruption. Corruption breaks the constitution\\xad\\nally necessary “chain of communication” between the\\npeople and their representatives. It derails the essential\\nspeech-to-government-action tie. Where enough money\\ncalls the tune, the general public will not be heard. Inso\\xad\\nfar as corruption cuts the link between political thought\\nand political action, a free marketplace of political ideas\\nloses its point. That is one reason why the Court has\\nstressed the constitutional importance of Congress’ con\\xad\\ncern that a few large donations not drown out the voices of\\nthe many. See, e.g., Buckley, 424 U. S., at 26–27.\\n   That is also why the Court has used the phrase “subver\\xad\\nsion of the political process” to describe circumstances in\\nwhich “[e]lected officials are influenced to act contrary to\\ntheir obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain\\nto themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns.”\\nNCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497. See also Federal Election\\nComm’n v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197,\\n208 (1982) (the Government’s interests in preventing\\ncorruption “directly implicate the integrity of our electoral\\nprocess” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\\nSee generally R. Post, Citizens Divided: Campaign Fi\\xad\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

And a cynical public can lose\\ninterest in political participation altogether. See Nixon v.\\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 390\\n(2000) (“[T]he cynical assumption that large donors call\\nthe tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take\\npart in democratic governance”). Democracy, the Court\\nhas often said, cannot work unless “the people have faith\\nin those who govern.” United States v. Mississippi Valley\\nGenerating Co., 364 U. S. 520, 562 (1961).\\n   The upshot is that the interests the Court has long\\ndescribed as preventing “corruption” or the “appearance of\\ncorruption” are more than ordinary factors to be weighed\\nagainst the constitutional right to political speech. Rather,\\nthey are interests rooted in the First Amendment it-\\nself. They are rooted in the constitutional effort to create\\na democracy responsive to the people—a government\\nwhere laws reflect the very thoughts, views, ideas, and\\nsentiments, the expression of which the First Amendment\\nprotects. Given that end, we can and should understand\\ncampaign finance laws as resting upon a broader and\\nmore significant constitutional rationale than the plural-\\nity’s limited definition of “corruption” suggests. We should\\nsee these laws as seeking in significant part to strengthen,\\nrather than weaken, the First Amendment. To say this is\\nnot to deny the potential for conflict between (1) the need\\nto permit contributions that pay for the diffusion of ideas,\\nand (2) the need to limit payments in order to help main\\xad\\ntain the integrity of the electoral process. But that conflict\\ntakes place within, not outside, the First Amendment’s\\n\\x0c8       MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nboundaries.\\n                              B\\n  Since the kinds of corruption that can destroy the link\\nbetween public opinion and governmental action extend\\nwell beyond those the plurality describes, the plurality’s\\nnotion of corruption is flatly inconsistent with the basic\\nconstitutional rationale I have just described. Thus, it\\nshould surprise no one that this Court’s case law (Citizens\\nUnited excepted) insists upon a considerably broader\\ndefinition.\\n  In Buckley, for instance, the Court said explicitly that\\naggregate limits were constitutional because they helped\\n“prevent evasion . . . [through] huge contributions to the\\ncandidate’s political party,” 424 U. S., at 26 (the contrary\\nto what the plurality today seems to believe, see ante, at\\n36–39). Moreover, Buckley upheld the base limits in\\nsignificant part because they helped thwart “the appear\\xad\\nance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the\\nopportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large indi-\\nvidual financial contributions.” 424 U. S., at 27 (emphasis\\nadded). And it said that Congress could reasonably con\\xad\\nclude that criminal laws forbidding “the giving and taking\\nof bribes” did not adequately “deal with the reality or\\nappearance of corruption.” Id., at 28. Bribery laws, the\\nCourt recognized, address “only the most blatant and\\nspecific attempts of those with money to influence gov\\xad\\nernmental action.” Ibid. The concern with corruption\\nextends further.\\n  Other cases put the matter yet more strongly. In\\nBeaumont, for example, the Court found constitutional a\\nban on direct contributions by corporations because of the\\nneed to prevent corruption, properly “understood not only\\nas quid pro quo agreements, but also as undue influence\\non an officeholder’s judgment.” Federal Election Comm’n\\nv. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146, 155–156 (2003). In Federal\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nElection Comm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal Cam-\\npaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 441, 457–460 (2001) (Colo-\\nrado II ), the Court upheld limits imposed upon coordinated\\nexpenditures among parties and candidates because it\\nfound they thwarted corruption and its appearance, again\\nunderstood as including “undue influence” by wealthy\\ndonors. In Shrink Missouri, the Court upheld limitations\\nimposed by the Missouri Legislature upon contributions to\\nstate political candidates, not only because of the need to\\nprevent bribery, but also because of “the broader threat\\nfrom politicians too compliant with the wishes of large\\ncontributors.” 528 U. S., at 389.\\n                              C\\n  Most important, in McConnell, this Court considered the\\nconstitutionality of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act\\nof 2002, an Act that set new limits on “soft money” contri\\xad\\nbutions to political parties. “Soft money” referred to funds\\nthat, prior to BCRA, were freely donated to parties for\\nactivities other than directly helping elect a federal candi\\xad\\ndate—activities such as voter registration, “get out the\\nvote” drives, and advertising that did not expressly advo\\xad\\ncate a federal candidate’s election or defeat. 540 U. S., at\\n122–124. BCRA imposed a new ban on soft money contri\\xad\\nbutions to national party committees, and greatly cur\\xad\\ntailed them in respect to state and local parties. Id., at\\n133–134, 161–164.\\n  The Court in McConnell upheld these new contribution\\nrestrictions under the First Amendment for the very rea\\xad\\nson the plurality today discounts or ignores. Namely,\\nthe Court found they thwarted a significant risk of cor\\xad\\nruption—understood not as quid pro quo bribery, but as\\nprivileged access to and pernicious influence upon elected\\nrepresentatives.\\n   In reaching its conclusion in McConnell, the Court relied\\nupon a vast record compiled in the District Court. That\\n\\x0c10      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nrecord consisted of over 100,000 pages of material and\\nincluded testimony from more than 200 witnesses. See\\n251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 209 (DC 2003) (per curiam). What it\\nshowed, in detail, was the web of relationships and un-\\nderstandings among parties, candidates, and large donors\\nthat underlies privileged access and influence.            See\\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 146–152, 154–157, 167–171, 182–\\n184. The District Judges in McConnell made clear that\\nthe record did “not contain any evidence of bribery or vote\\nbuying in exchange for donations of nonfederal money.”\\n251 F. Supp. 2d, at 481 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.)\\n(emphasis added). Indeed, no one had identified a “single\\ndiscrete instance of quid pro quo corruption” due to soft\\nmoney. Id., at 395 (opinion of Henderson, J.). But what\\nthe record did demonstrate was that enormous soft money\\ncontributions, ranging between $1 million and $5 million\\namong the largest donors, enabled wealthy contributors to\\ngain disproportionate “access to federal lawmakers” and\\nthe ability to “influenc[e] legislation.” Id., at 481 (opinion\\nof Kollar-Kotelly, J.). There was an indisputable link\\nbetween generous political donations and opportunity\\nafter opportunity to make one’s case directly to a Member\\nof Congress.\\n    Testimony by elected officials supported this conclusion.\\nSee, e.g., ibid. (“ ‘Large donors of both hard and soft money\\nreceive special treatment’ ” (Sen. Simpson)); id., at 482\\n(“ ‘Donations, including soft money donations to political\\nparties, do affect how Congress operates. It’s only natural,\\nand happens all too often, that a busy Senator with 10\\nminutes to spare will spend those minutes returning the\\ncall of a large soft money donor’ ” (Sen. Boren)); id., at 496\\n(“ ‘At a minimum, large soft money donations purchase an\\nopportunity for the donors to make their case to elected\\nofficials . . .’ ” (Sen. McCain)). Furthermore, testimony\\nfrom party operatives showed that national political par\\xad\\nties had created “major donor programs,” through which\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

I have\\nplaced in Appendix A more examples of the kind of evi\\xad\\ndence that filled the District Court record in McConnell.\\n  This Court upheld BCRA’s limitations on soft money\\ncontributions by relying on just the kind of evidence I have\\ndescribed. We wrote:\\n    “The evidence in the record shows that candidates and\\n    donors alike have in fact exploited the soft-money\\n    loophole, the former to increase their prospects of\\n    election and the latter to create debt on the part of of\\xad\\n    ficeholders . . . . Plaintiffs argue that without concrete\\n    evidence of an instance in which a federal officeholder\\n    has actually switched a vote [in exchange for soft\\n    money] . . . , Congress has not shown that there exists\\n    real or apparent corruption. . . . [P]laintiffs conceive of\\n    corruption too narrowly. Our cases have firmly estab\\xad\\n    lished that Congress’ legitimate interest extends be\\xad\\n    yond preventing simple cash-for-votes corruption to\\n    curbing ‘undue influence on an officeholder’s judg\\xad\\n    ment, and the appearance of such influence.’ ” 540\\n    U. S., at 146, 149–150 (quoting Colorado II, 533 U. S.,\\n    at 441; emphasis added; paragraphs and paragraph\\n    breaks omitted).\\nWe specifically rejected efforts to define “corruption” in\\nways similar to those the plurality today accepts. We\\nadded:\\n    “Just as troubling to a functioning democracy as clas\\xad\\n    sic quid pro quo corruption is the danger that office\\xad\\n    holders will decide issues not on the merits or the\\n    desires of their constituencies, but according to the\\n    wishes of those who have made large financial contri\\xad\\n    butions valued by the officeholder.” 540 U.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nrower definition of “corruption,” and hence of the public’s\\ninterest in political integrity, it is flatly inconsistent with\\nMcConnell.\\n                               D\\n   One case, however, contains language that offers the\\nplurality support. That case is Citizens United. There, as\\nthe plurality points out, ante, at 19, the Court said that\\n“[w]hen Buckley identified a sufficiently important gov\\xad\\nernmental interest in preventing corruption or the ap\\xad\\npearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid\\npro quo corruption.” 558 U. S., at 359. Further, the Court\\nsaid that quid pro quo corruption does not include “influ\\xad\\nence over or access to elected officials,” because “ ‘generic\\nfavoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard\\nFirst Amendment analyses.’ ” Ibid. (quoting McConnell,\\nsupra, at 296 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in\\npart and dissenting in part)).\\n   How should we treat these statements from Citizens\\nUnited now? They are not essential to the Court’s holding\\nin the case—at least insofar as it can be read to require\\nfederal law to treat corporations and trade unions like\\nindividuals when they independently pay for, e.g., televi\\xad\\nsion advertising during the last 60 days of a federal elec\\xad\\ntion. Citizens United, supra, at 365. Taken literally, the\\nstatements cited simply refer to and characterize still\\xad\\nearlier Court cases. They do not require the more absolute\\nreading that the plurality here gives them.\\n   More than that. Read as the plurality reads them to\\xad\\nday, the statements from Citizens United about the proper\\ncontours of the corruption rationale conflict not just with\\nlanguage in the McConnell opinion, but with McConnell’s\\nvery holding. See supra, at 9–11. Did the Court in Citi-\\nzens United intend to overrule McConnell? I doubt it, for\\nif it did, the Court or certainly the dissent would have said\\nsomething about it. The total silence of all opinions in\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nCitizens United with respect to this matter argues strongly\\nin favor of treating the language quoted above as dic-\\ntum, as an overstatement, or as limited to the context in\\nwhich it appears. Citizens United itself contains language\\nthat supports the last mentioned reading, for it says that\\n“[Buckley] did not extend this rationale [about the reality\\nor appearance of corruption] to independent expenditures,\\nand the Court does not do so here.” 558 U. S., at 357\\n(emphasis added). And it adds that, while “[t]he BCRA\\nrecord establishes that certain donations to political par\\xad\\nties, called ‘soft money,’ were made to gain access to elected\\nofficials,” “[t]his case, however, is about independent\\nexpenditures, not soft money.” Id., at 360–361 (emphasis\\nadded).\\n   The plurality’s use of Citizens United’s narrow definition\\nof corruption here, however, is a different matter. That\\nuse does not come accompanied with a limiting context\\n(independent expenditures by corporations and unions) or\\nlimiting language. It applies to the whole of campaign\\nfinance regulation. And, as I have pointed out, it is flatly\\ninconsistent with the broader definition of corruption upon\\nwhich McConnell’s holding depends.\\n   So: Does the Court intend today to overrule McConnell?\\nOr does it intend to leave McConnell and BCRA in place?\\nThe plurality says the latter. Ante, at 20–21, n. 6 (“Our\\nholding about the constitutionality of the aggregate limits\\nclearly does not overrule McConnell’s holding about ‘soft\\nmoney’ ”). But how does the plurality explain its rejection\\nof the broader definition of corruption, upon which\\nMcConnell’s holding depends? Compare ante, at 18–21,\\nwith McConnell, 540 U. S., at 146, 149–153.\\n                            III\\n  The plurality invalidates the aggregate contribution\\nlimits for a second reason.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nlimits on direct contributions to individuals, political\\nparties, and political action committees. Ante, at 22–29.\\nCf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 38 (aggregate limits “prevent\\nevasion” of base contribution limits). Other “campaign\\nfinance laws,” combined with “experience” and “common\\nsense,” foreclose the various circumvention scenarios that\\nthe Government hypothesizes. Ante, at 28. Accordingly,\\nthe plurality concludes, the aggregate limits provide no\\nadded benefit.\\n   The plurality is wrong. Here, as in Buckley, in the\\nabsence of limits on aggregate political contributions,\\ndonors can and likely will find ways to channel millions of\\ndollars to parties and to individual candidates, producing\\nprecisely the kind of “corruption” or “appearance of cor\\xad\\nruption” that previously led the Court to hold aggregate\\nlimits constitutional. Those opportunities for circumven\\xad\\ntion will also produce the type of corruption that concerns\\nthe plurality today. The methods for using today’s opinion\\nto evade the law’s individual contribution limits are com\\xad\\nplex, but they are well known, or will become well known,\\nto party fundraisers. I shall describe three.\\n                             A\\n  Example One: Gifts for the Benefit of the Party. Cam\\xad\\npaign finance law permits each individual to give $64,800\\nover two years to a national party committee. 2 U. S. C.\\n§441a(a)(1)(B); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532 (2013). The two major\\npolitical parties each have three national committees.\\nAnte, at 4, n. 1. Federal law also entitles an individual to\\ngive $20,000 to a state party committee over two years.\\n§441a(a)(1)(D). Each major political party has 50 such\\ncommittees. Those individual limits mean that, in the\\nabsence of any aggregate limit, an individual could legally\\ngive to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party\\nabout $1.2 million over two years. See Appendix B, Table\\n1, infra, at 39. To make it easier for contributors to give\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

The titular heads could be the Speaker of the\\nHouse of Representatives and the Minority Leader of the\\nHouse. A contributor could then write a single check to\\nthe Joint Party Committee—and its staff would divide the\\nfunds so that each constituent unit receives no more than\\nit could obtain from the contributor directly ($64,800 for a\\nnational committee over two years, $20,000 for a state\\ncommittee over the same). Before today’s decision, the\\ntotal size of Rich Donor’s check to the Joint Party Commit\\xad\\ntee was capped at $74,600—the aggregate limit for dona\\xad\\ntions to political parties over a 2-year election cycle. See\\n§441a(a)(3)(B); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532. After today’s decision,\\nRich Donor can write a single check to the Joint Party\\nCommittee in an amount of about $1.2 million.\\n   Will political parties seek these large checks? Why not?\\nThe recipient national and state committees can spend the\\nmoney to buy generic party advertisements, say television\\ncommercials or bumper stickers saying “Support Republi\\xad\\ncans,” “Support Democrats,” or the like. They also can\\ntransfer the money to party committees in battleground\\nStates to increase the chances of winning hotly contested\\nseats. See §441a(a)(4) (permitting national or state po-\\nlitical committees to make unlimited “transfers” to other\\ncommittees “of the same political party”).\\n   Will party officials and candidates solicit these large\\ncontributions from wealthy donors? Absolutely. Such con-\\ntributions will help increase the party’s power, as well\\nas the candidate’s standing among his colleagues.\\n   Will elected officials be particularly grateful to the large\\ndonor, feeling obliged to provide him special access and\\ninfluence, and perhaps even a quid pro quo legislative\\nfavor? That is what we have previously believed. See\\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 182 (“Large soft-money donations\\nat a candidate’s or officeholder’s behest give rise to all of\\n\\x0c16      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nthe same corruption concerns posed by contributions made\\ndirectly to the candidate or officeholder”); id., at 308 (opin\\xad\\nion of KENNEDY, J.) (“The making of a solicited gift is a\\nquid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who\\nsolicits the payment”); Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 460, n. 23\\n(explaining how a candidate can “become a player [in his\\nparty] beyond his own race” by “directing donations to the\\nparty and making sure that the party knows who raised\\nthe money,” and that “the donor’s influence is multiplied”\\nin such instances). And, as the statements collected in\\nAppendix A, infra, make clear, we have believed this with\\ngood reason.\\n   Example Two: Donations to Individual Candidates (The\\n$3.6 Million Check). The first example significantly un-\\nderstates the problem. That is because federal election\\nlaw also allows a single contributor to give $5,200 to each\\nparty candidate over a 2-year election cycle (assuming the\\ncandidate is running in both a primary and a general\\nelection). §441a(a)(1)(A); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532. There are\\n435 party candidates for House seats and 33 party candi\\xad\\ndates for Senate seats in any given election year. That\\nmakes an additional $2.4 million in allowable contribu\\xad\\ntions. Thus, without an aggregate limit, the law will\\npermit a wealthy individual to write a check, over a 2-year\\nelection cycle, for $3.6 million—all to benefit his political\\nparty and its candidates. See Appendix B, Table 2(a),\\ninfra, at 39.\\n   To make it easier for a wealthy donor to make a contri\\xad\\nbution of this size, the parties can simply enlarge the\\ncomposition of the Joint Party Committee described in\\nExample One, so that it now includes party candidates.\\nAnd a party can proliferate such joint entities, perhaps\\ncalling the first the “Smith Victory Committee,” the second\\nthe “Jones Victory Committee,” and the like. See 11 CFR\\n§102.17(c)(5) (2012). (I say “perhaps” because too trans\\xad\\nparent a name might call into play certain earmarking\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nrules. But the Federal Election Commission’s (FEC)\\ndatabase of joint fundraising committees in 2012 shows\\nsimilarly named entities, e.g., “Landrieu Wyden Victory\\nFund,” etc.).\\n   As I have just said, without any aggregate limit, the law\\nwill allow Rich Donor to write a single check to, say, the\\nSmith Victory Committee, for up to $3.6 million. This\\ncheck represents “the total amount that the contributor\\ncould contribute to all of the participants” in the Commit\\xad\\ntee over a 2-year cycle. §102.17(c)(5). The Committee\\nwould operate under an agreement that provides a “for-\\nmula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds” among its\\nconstituent units. §102.17(c)(1). And that “formula”\\nwould divide the proceeds so that no committee or can-\\ndidate receives more than it could have received from\\nRich Donor directly—$64,800, $20,000, or $5,200. See\\n§102.17(c)(6).\\n   So what is wrong with that? The check is considerably\\nlarger than Example One’s check. But is there anything\\nelse wrong? The answer is yes, absolutely. The law will\\nalso permit a party and its candidates to shift most of Rich\\nDonor’s contributions to a single candidate, say Smith.\\nHere is how:\\n   The law permits each candidate and each party commit\\xad\\ntee in the Smith Victory Committee to write Candidate\\nSmith a check directly. For his primary and general\\nelections combined, they can write checks of up to $4,000\\n(from each candidate’s authorized campaign committee)\\nand $10,000 (from each state and national committee). 2\\nU. S. C. §§432(e)(3)(B), 441a(a)(2)(A); 11 CFR §110.3(b).\\nThis yields a potential $1,872,000 (from candidates) plus\\n$530,000 (from party committees). Thus, the law permits\\nthe candidates and party entities to redirect $2.37 million\\nof Rich Donor’s $3.6 million check to Candidate Smith. It\\nalso permits state and national committees to contribute\\nto Smith’s general election campaign through making\\n\\x0c18      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\ncoordinated expenditures—in amounts that range from\\n$46,600 to $2.68 million for a general election (depending\\nupon the size of Smith’s State and whether he is running\\nfor a House or Senate seat). 78 Fed. Reg. 8530–8532. See\\nAppendix B, Table 2(b), infra, at 40.\\n   The upshot is that Candidate Smith can receive at least\\n$2.37 million and possibly the full $3.6 million contributed\\nby Rich Donor to the Smith Victory Committee, even\\nthough the funds must first be divided up among the\\nconstituent units before they can be rerouted to Smith.\\nNothing requires the Smith Victory Committee to explain\\nin advance to Rich Donor all of the various transfers that\\nwill take place, and nothing prevents the entities in the\\nCommittee from informing the donor and the receiving\\ncandidate after the fact what has transpired. Accordingly,\\nthe money can be donated and rerouted to Candidate\\nSmith without the donor having violated the base limits\\nor any other FEC regulation. And the evidence in the\\nMcConnell record reprinted in Appendix A, infra—with\\nrespect to soft money contributions—makes clear that\\nCandidate Smith will almost certainly come to learn from\\nwhom he has received this money.\\n   The parties can apply the same procedure to other large\\ndonations, channeling money from Rich Donor Two to\\nCandidate Jones. If 10 or 20 candidates face particularly\\ntight races, party committees and party candidates may\\nwork together to channel Rich Donor One’s multimillion\\ndollar contribution to the Most Embattled Candidate (e.g.,\\nCandidate Smith), Rich Donor Two’s multimillion dollar\\ncontribution to the Second Most Embattled Candidate\\n(e.g., Candidate Jones), and so on down the line. If this\\ndoes not count as evasion of the base limits, what does?\\nPresent aggregate limits confine the size of any individual\\ngift to $123,200. Today’s opinion creates a loophole meas\\xad\\nured in the millions.\\n   Example Three: Proliferating Political Action Commit-\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U.

Campaign finance law prohibits an individual\\nfrom contributing (1) more than $5,200 to any candidate in\\na federal election cycle, and (2) more than $5,000 to a PAC\\nin a calendar year. 2 U. S. C. §§441a(a)(1)(A), (C); 78 Fed.\\nReg. 8532. It also prohibits (3) any PAC from contributing\\nmore than $10,000 to any candidate in an election cycle.\\n§441(a)(2)(A). But the law does not prohibit an individual\\nfrom contributing (within the current $123,200 biannual\\naggregate limit) $5,000 to each of an unlimited total num\\xad\\nber of PACs. And there, so to speak, lies the rub.\\n  Here is how, without any aggregate limits, a party will\\nbe able to channel $2 million from each of ten Rich Do-\\nnors to each of ten Embattled Candidates. Groups of party\\nsupporters—individuals, corporations, or trade unions—\\ncreate 200 PACs. Each PAC claims it will use the funds it\\nraises to support several candidates from the party,\\nthough it will favor those who are most endangered.\\n(Each PAC qualifies for “multicandidate” status because it\\nhas received contributions from more than 50 persons and\\nhas made contributions to five federal candidates at some\\npoint previously. §441a(a)(4); 11 CFR §100.5(e)(3)). Over\\na 2-year election cycle, Rich Donor One gives $10,000 to\\neach PAC ($5,000 per year)—yielding $2 million total.\\nRich Donor 2 does the same. So, too, do the other eight\\nRich Donors. This brings their total donations to $20\\nmillion, disbursed among the 200 PACs. Each PAC will\\nhave collected $100,000, and each can use its money to\\nwrite ten checks of $10,000—to each of the ten most Em\\xad\\nbattled Candidates in the party (over two years). See\\nAppendix B, Table 3, infra, at 41. Every Embattled Can\\xad\\ndidate, receiving a $10,000 check from 200 PACs, will\\nhave collected $2 million.\\n  The upshot is that ten Rich Donors will have contrib-\\nuted $2 million each, and ten Embattled Candidates will\\nhave collected $2 million each. In this example, unlike\\nExample Two, the recipient candidates may not know\\n\\x0c20      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nwhich of the ten Rich Donors is personally responsible for\\nthe $2 million he or she receives. But the recipient candi\\xad\\ndate is highly likely to know who the ten Rich Donors are,\\nand to feel appropriately grateful. Moreover, the ability of\\na small group of donors to contribute this kind of money to\\nthreatened candidates is not insignificant. In the example\\nabove—with ten Rich Donors giving $2 million each, and\\nten Embattled Candidates receiving $2 million each—the\\ncontributions would have been enough to finance a consid\\xad\\nerable portion of, and perhaps all of, the candidates’ races\\nin the 2012 elections. See Appendix C, Table 1, infra, at\\n42 (showing that in 2012, the average winning House\\ncandidate spent $1.6 million and the average winning\\nSenate candidate spent $11.5 million).\\n                              B\\n   The plurality believes that the three scenarios I have\\njust depicted either pose no threat, or cannot or will not\\ntake place. It does not believe the scenario depicted in\\nExample One is any cause for concern, because it involves\\nonly “general, broad-based support of a political party.”\\nAnte, at 37. Not so. A candidate who solicits a multimil\\xad\\nlion dollar check for his party will be deeply grateful to the\\ncheckwriter, and surely could reward him with a quid pro\\nquo favor. The plurality discounts the scenarios depicted\\nin Example Two and Example Three because it finds such\\ncircumvention tactics “illegal under current campaign\\nfinance laws,” “implausible,” or “divorced from reality.”\\nAnte, at 23, 24, 28. But they are not.\\n   The plurality’s view depends in large part upon its claim\\nthat since this Court decided Buckley in 1976, changes in\\neither statutory law or in applicable regulations have\\ncome to make it difficult, if not impossible, for these cir\\xad\\ncumvention scenarios to arise. Hence, it concludes, there\\nis no longer a need for aggregate contribution limits. See\\nante, at 11–13, 22–29. But a closer examination of the five\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nlegal changes to which the plurality points makes clear\\nthat those changes cannot effectively stop the abuses that\\nI have depicted.\\n   First, the plurality points out that in 1976 (a few\\nmonths after this Court decided Buckley) Congress “added\\nlimits on contributions to political committees,” i.e., to\\nPACs. Ante, at 11; accord, 90 Stat. 487 (codified at 2\\nU. S. C. §441a(a)(1)(C)). But Example Three, the here\\xad\\nrelevant example, takes account of those limits, namely,\\n$5,000 to a PAC in any given year. And it shows that the\\nper-PAC limit does not matter much when it comes to the\\npotential for circumvention, as long as party supporters\\ncan create dozens or hundreds of PACs. Federal law\\nplaces no upper limit on the number of PACs supporting a\\nparty or a group of party candidates that can be estab\\xad\\nlished. And creating a PAC is primarily a matter of pa\\xad\\nperwork, a knowledgeable staff person, and a little time.\\n   Second, the plurality points out that in 1976, Congress\\n“also added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors\\nfrom creating or controlling multiple affiliated political\\ncommittees.” Ante, at 12. The rule provides that “all\\ncontributions made by political committees established or\\nfinanced or maintained or controlled” by the same corpora\\xad\\ntion, labor organization, person, or group of persons, “shall\\nbe considered to have been made by a single political\\ncommittee.” §441a(a)(5). But different supporters can\\ncreate different PACs. Indeed, there were roughly 2,700\\n“nonconnected” PACs (i.e., PACs not connected to a spe-\\ncific corporation or labor union) operating during the 2012\\nelections. Ante, at 24. In a future without aggregate\\ncontribution limits, far more nonconnected PACs will\\nlikely appear. The plurality also notes that the FEC can\\nexamine certain “ ‘circumstantial factors,’ ” such as “ ‘com\\xad\\nmon or overlapping membership’ ” or “ ‘similar patterns of\\ncontributions,’ ” to determine whether a group of PACs are\\naffiliated. Ante, at 25 (quoting 11 CFR §100.5(g)(4)(ii)).\\n\\x0c22     MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nBut the ultimate question in the affiliation inquiry is\\nwhether “one committee or organization [has] been estab\\xad\\nlished, financed, maintain or controlled by another com\\xad\\nmittee or sponsoring organization.” Ibid. Just because a\\ngroup of multicandidate PACs all support the same party\\nand all decide to donate funds to a group of endangered\\ncandidates in that party does not mean they will qualify\\nas “affiliated” under the relevant definition. This rule\\nappears inadequate to stop the sort of circumvention\\ndepicted in Example Three.\\n   Third, the plurality says that a post-Buckley regulation\\nhas strengthened the statute’s earmarking provision.\\nAnte, at 12. Namely, the plurality points to a rule pro-\\nmulgated by the FEC in 1976, specifying that earmarking\\nincludes any “designation ‘whether direct or indirect,\\nexpress or implied, oral or written.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 11\\nCFR §110.6(b)); accord, 41 Fed. Reg. 35950 (1976). This\\nmeans that if Rich Donor were to give $5,000 to a PAC\\nwhile “designat[ing]” (in any way) that the money go to\\nCandidate Smith, those funds must count towards Rich\\nDonor’s total allowable contributions to Smith—$5,200 per\\nelection cycle. But the virtually identical earmarking\\nprovision in effect when this Court decided Buckley would\\nhave required the same thing. That provision also counted,\\nwhen applying the base contribution limits, “all contri-\\nbutions made by a person, either directly or indirectly, on\\nbehalf of a particular candidate, including contributions\\nwhich are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed\\nthrough an intermediary or conduit to a candidate.” 88\\nStat. 1264; accord, 2 U. S. C. §441a(a)(8) (same). What is\\nthe difference?\\n   Fourth, the plurality points out that the FEC’s regula\\xad\\ntions “specify that an individual who has contributed to a\\nparticular candidate committee may not also contribute to\\na single-candidate committee for that candidate.” Ante, at\\n12–13 (citing 11 CFR §110.1(h)(1); emphasis added). The\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           23\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nregulations, however, do not prevent a person who has\\ncontributed to a candidate from also contributing to multi-\\ncandidate committees that support the candidate. Indeed,\\nthe rules specifically authorize such contributions. See\\n§110.1(h) (“A person may contribute to a candidate . . . and\\nalso contribute to a political committee which has sup-\\nported, or anticipates supporting, the same candidate in\\nthe same election,” as long as the political committee is “not\\nthe candidate’s principal campaign committee” or a “single\\ncandidate committee” (emphasis added)). Example Three\\nillustrates the latter kind of contribution. And briefs\\nbefore us make clear that the possibility for circumventing\\nthe base limits through making such contributions is a\\nrealistic, not an illusory, one. See Brief for Appellee 36\\n(demonstrating that many PACs today explain in their\\npublic materials just what fairly small group of candidates\\nthey intend to support); Brief for Americans for Campaign\\nReform as Amicus Curiae 14–15 (similar).\\n   Fifth, the plurality points to another FEC regulation\\n(also added in 1976), which says that “an individual who\\nhas contributed to a candidate” may not “also contribute to\\na political committee that has supported or anticipates\\nsupporting the same candidate if the individual knows\\nthat ‘a substantial portion [of his contribution] will be\\ncontributed to, or expended on behalf of,’ that candidate.”\\nAnte, at 13 (quoting 11 CFR §110.1(h)(2); brackets in\\noriginal); accord, 41 Fed. Reg. 35948. This regulation is\\nimportant, for in principle, the FEC might use it to pre\\xad\\nvent the circumstances that Examples Two and Three set\\nforth from arising. And it is not surprising that the plu\\xad\\nrality relies upon the existence of this rule when it de\\xad\\nscribes those circumstances as “implausible,” “illegal,” or\\n“divorced from reality.” Ante, at 23, 24, 28.\\n   In fact, however, this regulation is not the strong anti\\xad\\ncircumvention weapon that the plurality imagines. De\\xad\\nspite the plurality’s assurances, it does not “disarm” the\\n\\x0c24      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\npossibilities for circumvention. Ante, at 23. That is be\\xad\\ncause the regulation requires a showing that donors have\\n“knowledge that a substantial portion” of their contribu\\xad\\ntions will be used by a PAC to support a candidate to\\nwhom they have already contributed. §110.1(h)(2) (em\\xad\\nphasis added). And “knowledge” is hard to prove.\\n   I have found nine FEC cases decided since the year 2000\\nthat refer to this regulation. In all but one, the FEC failed\\nto find the requisite “knowledge”—despite the presence of\\nExample Two or Example Three circumstances. See Fac\\xad\\ntual and Legal Analysis, In re: Transfund PAC, Matter\\nUnder Review (MUR) 6221, p. 11 (FEC, June 7, 2010)\\n(although the donor “might reasonably infer that some\\nportion of his contribution” to a candidate’s Leadership\\nPAC would be used to support the candidate, “such an\\ninference alone does not suggest that [he] had ‘actual\\nknowledge’ ” of such); Factual and Legal Analysis, In re:\\nJohn Shadegg’s Friends, MUR 5968, pp. 3, 6–7 (FEC, Nov.\\n10, 2008) (“[T]here is no basis on which to conclude that\\n[the donors] knew that the funds they contributed to\\nLEAD PAC would be used to support the Shadegg Com\\xad\\nmittee” even though Congressman Shadegg solicited the\\ndonations and LEAD PAC was Congressman Shadegg’s\\nLeadership PAC); Factual and Legal Analysis, In re: Wal-\\nberg for Congress, MUR 5881, pp. 6, 9–11 (FEC, Aug. 15,\\n2007) (finding seven contributors, who gave to a candidate\\nand to a PAC that provided 86% of the candidate’s financ\\xad\\ning, had not shown “knowledge”); Factual and Legal Anal\\xad\\nysis, In re: Matt Brown for Senate, MUR 5732, p. 11 (FEC,\\nApr. 4, 2007) (“Though it may be reasonable to infer that\\nthe individual donors solicited by Brown gave to the State\\nParties under the assumption that some portion of their\\ncontribution might then be donated to the Brown Commit\\xad\\ntee, such an inference alone is insufficient to find reason to\\nbelieve 11 CFR §110.1(h) has been violated”); First Gen\\xad\\neral Counsel’s Report, In re: Liffrig for Senate, MUR 5678,\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

Given this record of FEC\\n(in)activity, my reaction to the plurality’s reliance upon\\nagency enforcement of this rule (as an adequate substitute\\nfor Congress’ aggregate limits) is like Oscar Wilde’s after\\nreading Dickens’ account of the death of Little Nell: “One\\nmust have a heart of stone,” said Wilde, “to read [it] with\\xad\\nout laughing.” Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations\\n86 (N. Sherrin 2d ed. 2001).\\n   I have found one contrary example—the single example\\nto which the plurality refers. Ante, at 25 (citing Concilia\\xad\\ntion Agreement, In re Riley, MURs 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736\\n(FEC, Dec. 19, 2001)). In that case, the FEC found prob\\xad\\nable cause to believe that three individual contributors to\\nseveral PACs had the requisite “knowledge” that the PACs\\nwould use a “substantial portion” of their contributions to\\nsupport a candidate to whom they had already contributed—\\nSam Brownback, a candidate for the Senate (for two of\\nthe contributors), and Robert Riley, a candidate for the\\nHouse (for the third). The individuals had made donations\\nto several PACs operating as a network, under the direc\\xad\\ntion of a single political consulting firm. The two contribu\\xad\\ntors to Sam Brownback were his parents-in-law, and the\\nFEC believed they might be using the PAC network to\\nchannel extra support to him. The contributor to Robert\\nRiley was his son, and the FEC believed he might be doing\\nthe same. The facts in this case are unusual, for individ-\\nual contributors are not typically relatives of the candidates\\nthey are seeking to support, and ordinary PACs do not\\ntend to work in coordination under the direction of a con\\xad\\n\\x0c26     MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nsulting firm. In any event, this single swallow cannot\\nmake the plurality’s summer.\\n   Thus, it is not surprising that throughout the many\\nyears this FEC regulation has been in effect, political\\nparties and candidates have established ever more joint\\nfundraising committees (numbering over 500 in the last\\nfederal elections); candidates have established ever more\\n“Leadership PACs” (numbering over 450 in the last elec\\xad\\ntions); and party supporters have established ever more\\nmulticandidate PACs (numbering over 3,000 in the last\\nelections). See Appendix C, Tables 2–3, infra, at 42–43;\\nFEC, 2014 Committee Summary (reporting the number of\\n“qualified” (or multicandidate) PACs in 2012), online at\\nhttp://www.fec.gov/data/CommitteeSummary.do (all Inter\\xad\\nnet materials as visited Mar. 28, 2014, and available in\\nClerk of Court’s case file).\\n   Using these entities, candidates, parties, and party\\nsupporters can transfer and, we are told, have transferred\\nlarge sums of money to specific candidates, thereby avoid\\xad\\ning the base contribution limits in ways that Examples\\nTwo and Three help demonstrate. See Brief for Appellee\\n38–39, 53–54; Brief for Campaign Legal Center, et al. as\\nAmici Curiae 12–15; Brief of Democratic Members of the\\nUnited States House of Representatives as Amici Curiae\\n28–29. They have done so without drawing FEC prosecu\\xad\\ntion—at least not according to my (and apparently the\\nplurality’s) search of publicly available records. That is\\nlikely because in the real world, the methods of achieving\\ncircumvention are more subtle and more complex than our\\nstylized Examples Two and Three depict. And persons\\nhave used these entities to channel money to candidates\\nwithout any individual breaching the current aggregate\\n$123,200 limit. The plurality now removes that limit,\\nthereby permitting wealthy donors to make aggregate\\ncontributions not of $123,200, but of several millions of\\ndollars.

Ante, at 30. The First Amendment requires “ ‘a\\nfit that is . . . reasonable,’ ” and there is no such “fit” here\\nbecause there are several alternative ways Congress could\\nprevent evasion of the base limits. Ibid. (quoting Fox, 492\\nU. S., at 480). For instance, the plurality posits, Congress\\n(or the FEC) could “tighten . . . transfer rules”; it could\\nrequire “contributions above the current aggregate limits\\nto be deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts\\nand spent only by their recipients”; it could define “how\\nmany candidates a PAC must support in order to ensure\\nthat ‘a substantial portion’ of a donor’s contribution is not\\nrerouted to a certain candidate”; or it could prohibit “do\\xad\\nnors who have contributed the current maximum sums\\nfrom further contributing to political committees that have\\nindicated they will support candidates to whom the donor\\nhas already contributed.” Ante, at 33–35 (quoting 11 CFR\\n§110.1(h)(2)).\\n   The plurality, however, does not show, or try to show,\\nthat these hypothetical alternatives could effectively\\nreplace aggregate contribution limits. Indeed, it does not\\neven “opine on the validity of any particular proposal,”\\nante, at 35—presumably because these proposals them\\xad\\nselves could be subject to constitutional challenges. For\\nthe most part, the alternatives the plurality mentions\\nwere similarly available at the time of Buckley. Their\\nhypothetical presence did not prevent the Court from\\nupholding aggregate limits in 1976. How can their con\\xad\\ntinued hypothetical presence lead the plurality now to\\nconclude that aggregate limits are “poorly tailored?” See\\nante, at 30. How can their continued hypothetical pres\\xad\\nence lead the Court to overrule Buckley now?\\n\\x0c28      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\n  In sum, the explanation of why aggregate limits are\\nneeded is complicated, as is the explanation of why other\\nmethods will not work. But the conclusion is simple:\\nThere is no “substantial mismatch” between Congress’\\nlegitimate objective and the “means selected to achieve it.”\\nAnte, at 10. The Court, as in Buckley, should hold that\\naggregate contribution limits are constitutional.\\n                              V\\n   The District Court in this case, holding that Buckley\\nforeclosed McCutcheon’s constitutional challenge to the\\naggregate limits, granted the Government’s motion to\\ndismiss the complaint prior to a full evidentiary hearing.\\nSee 893 F. Supp. 2d 133, 140–141 (DC 2012). If the plu\\xad\\nrality now believes the District Court was wrong, then\\nwhy does it not return the case for the further evidentiary\\ndevelopment which has not yet taken place?\\n   In the past, when evaluating the constitutionality of\\ncampaign finance restrictions, we have typically relied\\nupon an evidentiary record amassed below to determine\\nwhether the law served a compelling governmental objec\\xad\\ntive. And, typically, that record contained testimony from\\nMembers of Congress (or state legislators) explaining why\\nCongress (or the legislature) acted as it did. See, e.g.,\\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 147–154 (upholding federal re\\xad\\nstrictions on soft money by drawing on an extensive Dis\\xad\\ntrict Court record that contained declarations from current\\nand former Members of Congress); Colorado II, 533 U. S.,\\nat 457–465 (upholding federal limits on coordinated ex\\xad\\npenditures between parties and candidates on the basis of\\na summary judgment record that contained declarations\\nfrom party operatives, fundraisers, and Members of Con\\xad\\ngress); Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 393 (upholding\\nMissouri’s contribution limits on the basis of the lower\\ncourt record, which contained similar declarations). If we\\nare to overturn an act of Congress here, we should do so on\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          29\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nthe basis of a similar record.\\n  For one thing, an evidentiary record can help us deter\\xad\\nmine whether or the extent to which we should defer to\\nCongress’ own judgments, particularly those reflecting a\\nbalance of the countervailing First Amendment interests\\nI have described. Determining whether anticorruption\\nobjectives justify a particular set of contribution limits\\nrequires answering empirically based questions, and ap-\\nplying significant discretion and judgment. To what ex\\xad\\ntent will unrestricted giving lead to corruption or its\\nappearance? What forms will any such corruption take?\\nTo what extent will a lack of regulation undermine public\\nconfidence in the democratic system? To what extent can\\nregulation restore it?\\n  These kinds of questions, while not easily answered, are\\nquestions that Congress is far better suited to resolve than\\nare judges. Thus, while court review of contribution limits\\nhas been and should be “rigorous,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at\\n29, we have also recognized that “deference to legislative\\nchoice is warranted.” Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 155. And\\nthat deference has taken account of facts and circum\\xad\\nstances set forth in an evidentiary record.\\n  For another thing, a comparison of the plurality’s opin\\xad\\nion with this dissent reveals important differences of\\nopinion on fact-related matters. We disagree, for example,\\non the possibilities for circumvention of the base limits in\\nthe absence of aggregate limits. We disagree about how\\neffectively the plurality’s “alternatives” could prevent\\nevasion. An evidentiary proceeding would permit the\\nparties to explore these matters, and it would permit the\\ncourts to reach a more accurate judgment. The plurality\\nrationalizes its haste to forgo an evidentiary record by\\nnoting that “the parties have treated the question as a\\npurely legal one.” Ante, at 14, n. 4. But without a doubt,\\nthe legal question—whether the aggregate limits are\\nclosely drawn to further a compelling governmental inter\\xad\\n\\x0c30      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nest—turns on factual questions about whether corruption,\\nin the absence of such limits, is a realistic threat to our\\ndemocracy. The plurality itself spends pages citing figures\\nabout campaign spending to defend its “legal” conclusion.\\nAnte, at 24–26, 27–28, 30–32. The problem with such\\nreasoning is that this Court’s expertise does not lie in\\nmarshaling facts in the primary instance. That is why in\\nthe past, when answering similar questions about the\\nconstitutionality of restrictions on campaign contributions,\\nwe have relied on an extensive evidentiary record pro\\xad\\nduced below to inform our decision.\\n   Without further development of the record, however, I\\nfail to see how the plurality can now find grounds for\\noverturning Buckley. The justification for aggregate con\\xad\\ntribution restrictions is strongly rooted in the need to\\nassure political integrity and ultimately in the First\\nAmendment itself. Part II, supra. The threat to that\\nintegrity posed by the risk of special access and influence\\nremains real. Part III, supra. Even taking the plurality\\non its own terms and considering solely the threat of quid\\npro quo corruption (i.e., money-for-votes exchanges), the\\naggregate limits are a necessary tool to stop circumven\\xad\\ntion. Ibid. And there is no basis for finding a lack of “fit”\\nbetween the threat and the means used to combat it,\\nnamely the aggregate limits. Part IV, supra.\\n   The plurality reaches the opposite conclusion. The re\\xad\\nsult, as I said at the outset, is a decision that substitutes\\njudges’ understandings of how the political process works\\nfor the understanding of Congress; that fails to recognize\\nthe difference between influence resting upon public opin\\xad\\nion and influence bought by money alone; that overturns\\nkey precedent; that creates huge loopholes in the law; and\\nthat undermines, perhaps devastates, what remains of\\ncampaign finance reform.\\n   With respect, I dissent.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

Pp. 7–40.\\n     (a) Appellants’ substantial First Amendment challenge to the cur-\\n  rent system of aggregate limits merits plenary consideration. Pp. 7–\\n  14.\\n       (1) In Buckley, this Court evaluated the constitutionality of the\\n  original contribution and expenditure limits in FECA. Buckley dis-\\n  tinguished the two types of limits based on the degree to which each\\n  encroaches upon protected First Amendment interests. It subjected\\n  expenditure limits to “the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations\\n  on core First Amendment rights of political expression.” 424 U. S., at\\n  44–45. But it concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser re-\\n  straint on political speech and thus applied a lesser but still “rigorous\\n  standard of review,” id., at 29, under which such limits “may be sus-\\n  tained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and\\n  employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of\\n  associational freedoms,” id., at 25. Because the Court found that the\\n  primary purpose of FECA—preventing quid pro quo corruption and\\n  its appearance—was a “sufficiently important” governmental inter-\\n  est, id., at 26–27, it upheld the base limit under the “closely drawn”\\n  test, id., at 29. After doing so, the Court devoted only one paragraph\\n  of its 139-page opinion to the aggregate limit then in place under\\n  FECA, noting that the provision “ha[d] not been separately addressed\\n  at length by the parties.” Id., at 38. It concluded that the aggregate\\n  limit served to prevent circumvention of the base limit and was “no\\n  more than a corollary” of that limit. Id., at 38. Pp. 7–9.\\n       (2) There is no need in this case to revisit Buckley’s distinction\\n  between contributions and expenditures and the corresponding dis-\\n  tinction in standards of review. Regardless whether strict scrutiny or\\n  the “closely drawn” test applies, the analysis turns on the fit between\\n  the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve\\n  that objective. Here, given the substantial mismatch between the\\n  Government’s stated objective and the means selected to achieve it,\\n  the aggregate limits fail even under the “closely drawn” test.\\n     Buckley’s ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the ag-\\n  gregate limit in place under FECA does not control here. Buckley\\n  spent just three sentences analyzing that limit, which had not been\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 572 U.

Appellants here, by contrast,\\nhave directly challenged the aggregate limits in place under BCRA, a\\ndifferent statutory regime whose limits operate against a distinct le-\\ngal backdrop. Most notably, statutory safeguards against circumven-\\ntion have been considerably strengthened since Buckley. The 1976\\nFECA Amendments added another layer of base limits—capping con-\\ntributions from individuals to political committees—and an antipro-\\nliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multi-\\nple affiliated political committees. Since Buckley, the Federal\\nElection Commission has also enacted an intricate regulatory scheme\\nthat further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base\\nlimits through “unearmarked contributions to political committees\\nlikely to contribute” to a particular candidate. 424 U. S., at 38. In\\naddition to accounting for such statutory and regulatory changes, ap-\\npellants raise distinct legal arguments not considered in Buckley, in-\\ncluding an overbreadth challenge to the aggregate limit. Pp. 10–14.\\n   (b) Significant First Amendment interests are implicated here.\\nContributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individual’s\\nright to participate in the electoral process through both political ex-\\npression and political association. A restriction on how many candi-\\ndates and committees an individual may support is hardly a “modest\\nrestraint” on those rights. The Government may no more restrict\\nhow many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell\\na newspaper how many candidates it may endorse. In its simplest\\nterms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contrib-\\nuting to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more\\ncandidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits. And\\nit is no response to say that the individual can simply contribute less\\nthan the base limits permit: To require one person to contribute at\\nlower levels because he wants to support more candidates or causes\\nis to penalize that individual for “robustly exercis[ing]” his First\\nAmendment rights.

Moreover,\\n    the only type of corruption that Congress may target is quid pro quo\\n    corruption. Spending large sums of money in connection with elec-\\n    tions, but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an\\n    officeholder’s official duties, does not give rise to quid pro quo corrup-\\n    tion. Nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large\\n    sums may garner “influence over or access to” elected officials or po-\\n    litical parties. Citizens United v.

J.). Pp. 18–21.\\n         (2) The Government argues that the aggregate limits further the\\n    permissible objective of preventing quid pro quo corruption. The dif-\\n    ficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in, they ban all contribu-\\n    tions of any amount, even though Congress’s selection of a base limit\\n    indicates its belief that contributions beneath that amount do not\\n    create a cognizable risk of corruption. The Government must thus\\n    defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent cir-\\n    cumvention of the base limits, a function they do not serve in any\\n    meaningful way. Given the statutes and regulations currently in ef-\\n    fect, Buckley’s fear that an individual might “contribute massive\\n    amounts of money to a particular candidate through . . . unear-\\n    marked contributions” to entities likely to support the candidate, 424\\n    U. S., at 38, is far too speculative. Even accepting Buckley’s circum-\\n    vention theory, it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive\\n    “massive amounts of money” that could be traced back to a particular\\n    donor uninhibited by the aggregate limits. The Government’s scenar-\\n    ios offered in support of that possibility are either illegal under cur-\\n    rent campaign finance laws or implausible. Pp. 21–30.\\n         (3) The aggregate limits also violate the First Amendment be-\\n    cause they are not “closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of\\n    associational freedoms.” Buckley, supra, at 25. The Government ar-\\n    gues that the aggregate limits prevent an individual from giving to\\n    too many initial recipients who might then recontribute a donation,\\n    but experience suggests that the vast majority of contributions are\\n    retained and spent by their recipients. And the Government has pro-\\n    vided no reason to believe that candidates or party committees would\\n    dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted.\\n    The indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate lim-\\n    its is thus disproportionate to the Government’s interest in prevent-\\n    ing circumvention.\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                     5\\n\\n                              Syllabus\\n\\n   Importantly, there are multiple alternatives available to Congress\\nthat would serve the Government’s interest in preventing circumven-\\ntion while avoiding “unnecessary abridgment” of First Amendment\\nrights. Buckley, supra, at 25. Such alternatives might include tar-\\ngeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political com-\\nmittees, or tighter earmarking rules. Transfers, after all, are the key\\nto the Government’s concern about circumvention, but they can be\\naddressed without such a direct and broad interference with First\\nAmendment rights. Pp. 30–35.\\n     (4) Disclosure of contributions also reduces the potential for\\nabuse of the campaign finance system. Disclosure requirements,\\nwhich are justified by “a governmental interest in ‘provid[ing] the\\nelectorate with information’ about the sources of election-related\\nspending,” Citizens United, supra, at 367, may deter corruption “by\\nexposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publici-\\nty,” Buckley, supra at 67. Disclosure requirements may burden\\nspeech, but they often represent a less restrictive alternative to flat\\nbans on certain types or quantities of speech. Particularly with mod-\\nern technology, disclosure now offers more robust protections against\\ncorruption than it did when Buckley was decided. Pp. 35–36.\\n   (d) The Government offers an additional rationale for the aggregate\\nlimits, arguing that the opportunity for corruption exists whenever a\\nlegislator is given a large check, even if the check consists of contri-\\nbutions within the base limits to be divided among numerous candi-\\ndates or committees. That rationale dangerously broadens the cir-\\ncumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in prior\\ncases. Buckley confined its analysis to the possibility that “massive\\namounts of money” could be funneled to a particular candidate in ex-\\ncess of the base limits. 424 U. S., at 38. Recasting as corruption a\\ndonor’s widely distributed support for a political party would dramat-\\nically expand government regulation of the political process. And\\nthough the Government suggests that solicitation of large contribu-\\ntions poses the corruption danger, the aggregate limits are not lim-\\nited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate. Pp. 36–\\n39.\\n   JUSTICE THOMAS agreed that the aggregate limits are invalid under\\nthe First Amendment, but would overrule Buckley v.

Although the Court accepted that\\npremise, it nevertheless rejected the overbreadth chal-\\nlenge for two reasons: First, it was too “difficult to isolate\\nsuspect contributions” based on a contributor’s subjective\\nintent. Id., at 30. Second, “Congress was justified in\\nconcluding that the interest in safeguarding against the\\nappearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity\\nfor abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary\\ncontributions be eliminated.” Ibid.\\n  Finally, in one paragraph of its 139-page opinion, the\\nCourt turned to the $25,000 aggregate limit under FECA.\\nAs a preliminary matter, it noted that the constitution-\\nality of the aggregate limit “ha[d] not been separately\\naddressed at length by the parties.” Id., at 38. Then, in\\nthree sentences, the Court disposed of any constitutional\\nobjections to the aggregate limit that the challengers\\nmight have had:\\n    “The overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate\\n    restriction upon the number of candidates and com-\\n    mittees with which an individual may associate him-\\n    self by means of financial support. But this quite\\n    modest restraint upon protected political activity\\n    serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution\\n    limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute\\n    massive amounts of money to a particular candidate\\n    through the use of unearmarked contributions to po-\\n    litical committees likely to contribute to that candi-\\n    date, or huge contributions to the candidate’s political\\n    party. The limited, additional restriction on associa-\\n    tional freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus\\n    no more than a corollary of the basic individual con-\\n    tribution limitation that we have found to be constitu-\\n    tionally valid.” Ibid.\\n\\x0c10      MCCUTCHEON v.

Buckley held that the\\nGovernment’s interest in preventing quid pro quo corrup-\\ntion or its appearance was “sufficiently important,” id., at\\n26–27; we have elsewhere stated that the same interest\\nmay properly be labeled “compelling,” see National Con-\\nservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 496–497, so\\nthat the interest would satisfy even strict scrutiny. More-\\nover, regardless whether we apply strict scrutiny or Buck-\\nley’s “closely drawn” test, we must assess the fit between\\nthe stated governmental objective and the means selected\\nto achieve that objective.

Or to put it another way, if a law that restricts politi-\\ncal speech does not “avoid unnecessary abridgement” of\\nFirst Amendment rights, Buckley, 424 U.

The Court determined that circum-\\nvention could occur when an individual legally contributes\\n“massive amounts of money to a particular candidate\\nthrough the use of unearmarked contributions” to entities\\nthat are themselves likely to contribute to the candidate.\\nIbid. For that reason, the Court upheld the $25,000 ag-\\ngregate limit.\\n   Although Buckley provides some guidance, we think\\nthat its ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of\\nthe aggregate limit in place under FECA does not control\\nhere. Buckley spent a total of three sentences analyzing\\nthat limit; in fact, the opinion pointed out that the consti-\\ntutionality of the aggregate limit “ha[d] not been separately\\naddressed at length by the parties.” Ibid. We are now\\nasked to address appellants’ direct challenge to the aggre-\\ngate limits in place under BCRA. BCRA is a different\\nstatutory regime, and the aggregate limits it imposes\\noperate against a distinct legal backdrop.\\n   Most notably, statutory safeguards against circumven-\\ntion have been considerably strengthened since Buckley\\nwas decided, through both statutory additions and the\\nintroduction of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. With\\nmore targeted anticircumvention measures in place today,\\nthe indiscriminate aggregate limits under BCRA appear\\nparticularly heavy-handed.\\n   The 1976 FECA Amendments, for example, added an-\\nother layer of base contribution limits. The 1974 version\\nof FECA had already capped contributions from political\\ncommittees to candidates, but the 1976 version added\\nlimits on contributions to political committees.

In\\neffect, the rule eliminates a donor’s ability to create and\\nuse his own political committees to direct funds in excess\\nof the individual base limits. It thus blocks a straightfor-\\nward method of achieving the circumvention that was the\\nunderlying concern in Buckley.\\n   The intricate regulatory scheme that the Federal Elec-\\ntion Commission has enacted since Buckley further limits\\nthe opportunities for circumvention of the base limits via\\n“unearmarked contributions to political committees likely\\nto contribute” to a particular candidate. 424 U.

For example, presumably because of its cursory\\ntreatment of the $25,000 aggregate limit, Buckley did not\\nseparately address an overbreadth challenge with respect\\nto that provision. The Court rejected such a challenge to\\nthe base limits because of the difficulty of isolating suspect\\ncontributions. The propriety of large contributions to in-\\ndividual candidates turned on the subjective intent of\\ndonors, and the Court concluded that there was no way to\\ntell which donors sought improper influence over legisla-\\ntors’ actions. See 424 U. S., at 30. The aggregate limit, on\\nthe other hand, was upheld as an anticircumvention\\nmeasure, without considering whether it was possible to\\ndiscern which donations might be used to circumvent the\\nbase limits. See id., at 38. The Court never addressed\\noverbreadth in the specific context of aggregate limits,\\nwhere such an argument has far more force.\\n  Given the foregoing, this case cannot be resolved merely\\nby pointing to three sentences in Buckley that were writ-\\nten without the benefit of full briefing or argument on the\\nissue.

S., at\\n38. But the Court characterized that restriction as a\\n“quite modest restraint upon protected political activity.”\\nIbid. We cannot agree with that characterization. An\\naggregate limit on how many candidates and committees\\nan individual may support through contributions is not a\\n“modest restraint” at all. The Government may no more\\nrestrict how many candidates or causes a donor may\\nsupport than it may tell a newspaper how many candi-\\ndates it may endorse.\\n   To put it in the simplest terms, the aggregate limits\\nprohibit an individual from fully contributing to the pri-\\nmary and general election campaigns of ten or more can-\\ndidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits\\nCongress views as adequate to protect against corruption.\\nThe individual may give up to $5,200 each to nine candi-\\ndates, but the aggregate limits constitute an outright ban\\non further contributions to any other candidate (beyond\\nthe additional $1,800 that may be spent before reaching\\nthe $48,600 aggregate limit).

The FEC’s analysis could take account\\nof a “common or overlapping membership” and “similar\\npatterns of contributions or contributors,” among other\\nconsiderations. §§100.5(g)(4)(ii)(D), (J). The FEC has in\\nthe past initiated enforcement proceedings against con-\\ntributors with such suspicious patterns of PAC donations.\\nSee, e.g., Conciliation Agreement, In re Riley, Matters\\nUnder Review 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (FEC, Dec. 19,\\n2001).\\n   On a more basic level, it is hard to believe that a rational\\nactor would engage in such machinations. In the example\\ndescribed, a dedicated donor spent $500,000—donating\\nthe full $5,000 to 100 different PACs—to add just $26,000\\nto Smith’s campaign coffers. That same donor, mean-\\nwhile, could have spent unlimited funds on independent\\nexpenditures on behalf of Smith. See Buckley, 424 U. S.,\\nat 44–51. Indeed, he could have spent his entire $500,000\\nadvocating for Smith, without the risk that his selected\\nPACs would choose not to give to Smith, or that he would\\nhave to share credit with other contributors to the PACs.\\n   We have said in the context of independent expenditures\\nthat “ ‘[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination of\\nan expenditure with the candidate or his agent . . . un-\\ndermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate.’ ”\\nCitizens United, 558 U.

As the District Court\\ncrafted the example, a donor gives a $500,000 check to\\na joint fundraising committee composed of a candidate, a\\nnational party committee, and “most of the party’s state\\nparty committees” (actually, 47 of the 50). \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"volume\"\u003e893\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"reporter\"\u003eF.

The committees divide up the money so that\\neach one receives the maximum contribution permissible\\nunder the base limits, but then each transfers its allocated\\nportion to the same single committee. That committee\\nuses the money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a\\nparticular candidate. If that scenario “seem[s] unlikely,”\\nthe District Court thought so, too. Ibid. But because the\\nDistrict Court could “imagine” that chain of events, it held\\nthat the example substantiated the Government’s circum-\\nvention concerns. Ibid.\\n  One problem, however, is that the District Court’s spec-\\nulation relies on illegal earmarking. Lest there be any\\nconfusion, a joint fundraising committee is simply a mech-\\nanism for individual committees to raise funds collectively,\\nnot to circumvent base limits or earmarking rules. See 11\\n——————\\n  9 The  Justice Department agrees. As Acting Assistant Attorney Gen-\\neral Mythili Raman recently testified before Congress: “We anticipate\\nseeing fewer cases of conduit contributions directly to campaign com-\\nmittees or parties, because individuals or corporations who wish to\\ninfluence elections or officials will no longer need to attempt to do so\\nthrough conduit contribution schemes that can be criminally prosecut-\\ned.

In any event, the donors described in those\\neight cases were typically alleged to have exceeded the\\nbase limits by $5,000 or less. The FEC’s failure to find the\\nrequisite knowledge in those cases hardly means that the\\nagency will be equally powerless to prevent a scheme in\\nwhich a donor routes millions of dollars in excess of the\\nbase limits to a particular candidate, as in the dissent’s\\n“Example Two.” And if an FEC official cannot establish\\nknowledge of circumvention (or establish affiliation) when\\nthe same ten donors contribute $10,000 each to 200 newly\\ncreated PACs, and each PAC writes a $10,000 check to the\\nsame ten candidates—the dissent’s “Example Three”—\\nthen that official has not a heart but a head of stone.

So-called “Levin funds”\\nare donations permissible under state law that may be\\nspent on certain federal election activity—namely, voter\\nregistration and identification, get-out-the-vote efforts, or\\ngeneric campaign activities. Levin funds are raised directly\\nby the state or local party committee that ultimately\\nspends them. §441i(b)(2)(B)(iv). That means that other\\nparty committees may not transfer Levin funds, solicit\\nLevin funds on behalf of the particular state or local com-\\nmittee, or engage in joint fundraising of Levin funds.

Congress might also consider a modified\\nversion of the aggregate limits, such as one that prohibits\\ndonors who have contributed the current maximum sums\\nfrom further contributing to political committees that have\\nindicated they will support candidates to whom the donor\\nhas already contributed. To be sure, the existing earmark-\\ning provision does not define “the outer limit of accept-\\nable tailoring.” Colorado Republican Federal Campaign\\nComm., 533 U. S., at 462.

In 1976, the Court observed that Congress\\ncould regard disclosure as “only a partial measure.” Buck-\\nley, 424 U. S., at 28. That perception was understandable\\nin a world in which information about campaign contribu-\\ntions was filed at FEC offices and was therefore virtually\\ninaccessible to the average member of the public. See\\nBrief for Cause of Action Institute as Amicus Curiae 15–\\n16. Today, given the Internet, disclosure offers much more\\nrobust protections against corruption. See Citizens United,\\nsupra, at 370–371. Reports and databases are availa-\\nble on the FEC’s Web site almost immediately after they\\nare filed, supplemented by private entities such as Open-\\nSecrets.org and FollowTheMoney.org. Because massive\\nquantities of information can be accessed at the click of a\\nmouse, disclosure is effective to a degree not possible at\\nthe time Buckley, or even McConnell, was decided.\\n   The existing aggregate limits may in fact encourage the\\nmovement of money away from entities subject to dis-\\nclosure. Because individuals’ direct contributions are\\nlimited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for\\npolitical speech. See Citizens United, supra, at 364. Indi-\\nviduals can, for example, contribute unlimited amounts to\\n501(c) organizations, which are not required to publicly\\ndisclose their donors.

See Tr.\\nof Oral Arg. 29–30, 50–52. The Government argued that\\nthere is an opportunity for corruption whenever a large\\ncheck is given to a legislator, even if the check consists of\\ncontributions within the base limits to be appropriately\\ndivided among numerous candidates and committees. The\\naggregate limits, the argument goes, ensure that the check\\namount does not become too large. That new rationale for\\nthe aggregate limits—embraced by the dissent, see post, at\\n15–17—does not wash. It dangerously broadens the cir-\\ncumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articu-\\nlated in our prior cases, and targets as corruption the\\ngeneral, broad-based support of a political party.\\n  In analyzing the base limits, Buckley made clear that\\nthe risk of corruption arises when an individual makes\\nlarge contributions to the candidate or officeholder him-\\nself. See 424 U. S., at 26–27. Buckley’s analysis of the\\naggregate limit under FECA was similarly confined. The\\nCourt noted that the aggregate limit guarded against an\\nindividual’s funneling—through circumvention—“massive\\namounts of money to a particular candidate.” Id., at 38\\n(emphasis added).

But there is a\\nclear, administrable line between money beyond the base\\nlimits funneled in an identifiable way to a candidate—for\\nwhich the candidate feels obligated—and money within\\nthe base limits given widely to a candidate’s party—for\\nwhich the candidate, like all other members of the party,\\nfeels grateful.\\n   When donors furnish widely distributed support within\\nall applicable base limits, all members of the party or\\nsupporters of the cause may benefit, and the leaders of the\\nparty or cause may feel particular gratitude. That grati-\\ntude stems from the basic nature of the party system, in\\nwhich party members join together to further common\\npolitical beliefs, and citizens can choose to support a party\\nbecause they share some, most, or all of those beliefs.

As Edmund Burke explained in his famous speech\\nto the electors of Bristol, a representative owes constitu-\\nents the exercise of his “mature judgment,” but judgment\\ninformed by “the strictest union, the closest correspond-\\nence, and the most unreserved communication with his\\nconstituents.” The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund\\nBurke 129–130 (J. Burke ed. 1867). Constituents have the\\nright to support candidates who share their views and\\nconcerns. Representatives are not to follow constituent\\norders, but can be expected to be cognizant of and respon-\\nsive to those concerns. Such responsiveness is key to the\\nvery concept of self-governance through elected officials.\\n  The Government has a strong interest, no less critical to\\nour democratic system, in combatting corruption and its\\nappearance. We have, however, held that this interest\\nmust be limited to a specific kind of corruption—quid pro\\nquo corruption—in order to ensure that the Government’s\\nefforts do not have the effect of restricting the First\\nAmendment right of citizens to choose who shall govern\\nthem.

In-\\nstead, the plurality alludes only to Buckley’s last remain-\\ning reason for devaluing political contributions relative to\\nexpenditures. See ante, at 8 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S.,\\nat 21). The relevant sentence from Buckley reads as\\nfollows:\\n    “A limitation on the amount of money a person may\\n    give to a candidate or campaign organization thus in-\\n    volves little direct restraint on his political commu-\\n    nication, for it permits the symbolic expression of\\n    support evidenced by a contribution but does not in\\n    any way infringe the contributor’s freedom to discuss\\n    candidates and issues.” Ibid.\\nThat proposition, read in full, cannot be squared with a\\nkey premise of today’s decision.\\n   Among the Government’s justifications for the aggregate\\nlimits set forth in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of\\n2002 (BCRA) is that “an individual can engage in the\\n‘symbolic act of contributing’ to as many entities as he\\nwishes.” Brief for Appellee 20. That is, the Government\\ncontends that aggregate limits are constitutional as long\\nas an individual can still contribute some token amount (a\\ndime, for example) to each of his preferred candidates.\\nThe plurality, quite correctly, rejects that argument,\\nnoting that “[i]t is no answer to say that the individual can\\nsimply contribute less money to more people.” Ante, at 16.\\nThat is so because “[t]o require one person to contribute at\\nlower levels than others because he wants to support more\\ncandidates or causes is to impose a special burden on\\nbroader participation in the democratic process.” Ibid.\\n   What the plurality does not recognize is that the same\\nlogic also defeats the reasoning from Buckley on which the\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U.

Under the plurality’s analysis,\\nlimiting the amount of money a person may give to a\\ncandidate does impose a direct restraint on his political\\ncommunication; if it did not, the aggregate limits at issue\\nhere would not create “a special burden on broader partic-\\nipation in the democratic process.” Ibid.

I regret only that the plurality does not\\nacknowledge that today’s decision, although purporting\\nnot to overrule Buckley, continues to chip away at its\\nfootings.\\n   In sum, what remains of Buckley is a rule without a\\nrationale. Contributions and expenditures are simply\\n“two sides of the same First Amendment coin,” and our ef-\\nforts to distinguish the two have produced mere “word\\ngames” rather than any cognizable principle of constitu-\\ntional law. Buckley, supra, at 241, 244 (Burger, C. J.,\\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). For that rea-\\nson, I would overrule Buckley and subject the aggregate\\nlimits in BCRA to strict scrutiny, which they would surely\\nfail. See Colorado I, 518 U.

Thus, it\\nshould surprise no one that this Court’s case law (Citizens\\nUnited excepted) insists upon a considerably broader\\ndefinition.\\n  In Buckley, for instance, the Court said explicitly that\\naggregate limits were constitutional because they helped\\n“prevent evasion . . . [through] huge contributions to the\\ncandidate’s political party,” 424 U. S., at 26 (the contrary\\nto what the plurality today seems to believe, see ante, at\\n36–39). Moreover, Buckley upheld the base limits in\\nsignificant part because they helped thwart “the appear\\xad\\nance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the\\nopportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large indi-\\nvidual financial contributions.” 424 U. S., at 27 (emphasis\\nadded). And it said that Congress could reasonably con\\xad\\nclude that criminal laws forbidding “the giving and taking\\nof bribes” did not adequately “deal with the reality or\\nappearance of corruption.” Id., at 28. Bribery laws, the\\nCourt recognized, address “only the most blatant and\\nspecific attempts of those with money to influence gov\\xad\\nernmental action.” Ibid. The concern with corruption\\nextends further.\\n  Other cases put the matter yet more strongly. In\\nBeaumont, for example, the Court found constitutional a\\nban on direct contributions by corporations because of the\\nneed to prevent corruption, properly “understood not only\\nas quid pro quo agreements, but also as undue influence\\non an officeholder’s judgment.” Federal Election Comm’n\\nv.

That case is Citizens United. There, as\\nthe plurality points out, ante, at 19, the Court said that\\n“[w]hen Buckley identified a sufficiently important gov\\xad\\nernmental interest in preventing corruption or the ap\\xad\\npearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid\\npro quo corruption.” 558 U.

Further, the Court\\nsaid that quid pro quo corruption does not include “influ\\xad\\nence over or access to elected officials,” because “ ‘generic\\nfavoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard\\nFirst Amendment analyses.’ ” Ibid. (quoting McConnell,\\nsupra, at 296 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in\\npart and dissenting in part)).\\n   How should we treat these statements from Citizens\\nUnited now?

Citizens United, supra, at 365. Taken literally, the\\nstatements cited simply refer to and characterize still\\xad\\nearlier Court cases.

Read as the plurality reads them to\\xad\\nday, the statements from Citizens United about the proper\\ncontours of the corruption rationale conflict not just with\\nlanguage in the McConnell opinion, but with McConnell’s\\nvery holding. See supra, at 9–11. Did the Court in Citi-\\nzens United intend to overrule McConnell? I doubt it, for\\nif it did, the Court or certainly the dissent would have said\\nsomething about it.

Citizens United itself contains language\\nthat supports the last mentioned reading, for it says that\\n“[Buckley] did not extend this rationale [about the reality\\nor appearance of corruption] to independent expenditures,\\nand the Court does not do so here.” 558 U. S., at 357\\n(emphasis added). And it adds that, while “[t]he BCRA\\nrecord establishes that certain donations to political par\\xad\\nties, called ‘soft money,’ were made to gain access to elected\\nofficials,” “[t]his case, however, is about independent\\nexpenditures, not soft money.” Id., at 360–361 (emphasis\\nadded).\\n   The plurality’s use of Citizens United’s narrow definition\\nof corruption here, however, is a different matter. That\\nuse does not come accompanied with a limiting context\\n(independent expenditures by corporations and unions) or\\nlimiting language. It applies to the whole of campaign\\nfinance regulation. And, as I have pointed out, it is flatly\\ninconsistent with the broader definition of corruption upon\\nwhich McConnell’s holding depends.\\n   So: Does the Court intend today to overrule McConnell?\\nOr does it intend to leave McConnell and BCRA in place?\\nThe plurality says the latter. Ante, at 20–21, n. 6 (“Our\\nholding about the constitutionality of the aggregate limits\\nclearly does not overrule McConnell’s holding about ‘soft\\nmoney’ ”). But how does the plurality explain its rejection\\nof the broader definition of corruption, upon which\\nMcConnell’s holding depends? Compare ante, at 18–21,\\nwith McConnell, 540 U. S., at 146, 149–153.\\n                            III\\n  The plurality invalidates the aggregate contribution\\nlimits for a second reason.

Buckley, 424 U. S., at 38 (aggregate limits “prevent\\nevasion” of base contribution limits). Other “campaign\\nfinance laws,” combined with “experience” and “common\\nsense,” foreclose the various circumvention scenarios that\\nthe Government hypothesizes. Ante, at 28. Accordingly,\\nthe plurality concludes, the aggregate limits provide no\\nadded benefit.\\n   The plurality is wrong. Here, as in Buckley, in the\\nabsence of limits on aggregate political contributions,\\ndonors can and likely will find ways to channel millions of\\ndollars to parties and to individual candidates, producing\\nprecisely the kind of “corruption” or “appearance of cor\\xad\\nruption” that previously led the Court to hold aggregate\\nlimits constitutional. Those opportunities for circumven\\xad\\ntion will also produce the type of corruption that concerns\\nthe plurality today. The methods for using today’s opinion\\nto evade the law’s individual contribution limits are com\\xad\\nplex, but they are well known, or will become well known,\\nto party fundraisers. I shall describe three.\\n                             A\\n  Example One: Gifts for the Benefit of the Party. Cam\\xad\\npaign finance law permits each individual to give $64,800\\nover two years to a national party committee. \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"volume\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"page\"\u003eC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class\u003d\"inline\"\u003e.\\n§441a(a)(1)(B); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532 (2013). The two major\\npolitical parties each have three national committees.\\nAnte, at 4, n. 1. Federal law also entitles an individual to\\ngive $20,000 to a state party committee over two years.\\n§441a(a)(1)(D). Each major political party has 50 such\\ncommittees. Those individual limits mean that, in the\\nabsence of any aggregate limit, an individual could legally\\ngive to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party\\nabout $1.2 million over two years. See Appendix B, Table\\n1, infra, at 39. To make it easier for contributors to give\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

The titular heads could be the Speaker of the\\nHouse of Representatives and the Minority Leader of the\\nHouse. A contributor could then write a single check to\\nthe Joint Party Committee—and its staff would divide the\\nfunds so that each constituent unit receives no more than\\nit could obtain from the contributor directly ($64,800 for a\\nnational committee over two years, $20,000 for a state\\ncommittee over the same). Before today’s decision, the\\ntotal size of Rich Donor’s check to the Joint Party Commit\\xad\\ntee was capped at $74,600—the aggregate limit for dona\\xad\\ntions to political parties over a 2-year election cycle. See\\n§441a(a)(3)(B); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532. After today’s decision,\\nRich Donor can write a single check to the Joint Party\\nCommittee in an amount of about $1.2 million.\\n   Will political parties seek these large checks? Why not?\\nThe recipient national and state committees can spend the\\nmoney to buy generic party advertisements, say television\\ncommercials or bumper stickers saying “Support Republi\\xad\\ncans,” “Support Democrats,” or the like. They also can\\ntransfer the money to party committees in battleground\\nStates to increase the chances of winning hotly contested\\nseats. See §441a(a)(4) (permitting national or state po-\\nlitical committees to make unlimited “transfers” to other\\ncommittees “of the same political party”).\\n   Will party officials and candidates solicit these large\\ncontributions from wealthy donors? Absolutely. Such con-\\ntributions will help increase the party’s power, as well\\nas the candidate’s standing among his colleagues.\\n   Will elected officials be particularly grateful to the large\\ndonor, feeling obliged to provide him special access and\\ninfluence, and perhaps even a quid pro quo legislative\\nfavor? That is what we have previously believed. See\\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 182 (“Large soft-money donations\\nat a candidate’s or officeholder’s behest give rise to all of\\n\\x0c16      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nthe same corruption concerns posed by contributions made\\ndirectly to the candidate or officeholder”); id., at 308 (opin\\xad\\nion of KENNEDY, J.) (“The making of a solicited gift is a\\nquid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who\\nsolicits the payment”); Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 460, n. 23\\n(explaining how a candidate can “become a player [in his\\nparty] beyond his own race” by “directing donations to the\\nparty and making sure that the party knows who raised\\nthe money,” and that “the donor’s influence is multiplied”\\nin such instances). And, as the statements collected in\\nAppendix A, infra, make clear, we have believed this with\\ngood reason.\\n   Example Two: Donations to Individual Candidates (The\\n$3.6 Million Check). The first example significantly un-\\nderstates the problem. That is because federal election\\nlaw also allows a single contributor to give $5,200 to each\\nparty candidate over a 2-year election cycle (assuming the\\ncandidate is running in both a primary and a general\\nelection). §441a(a)(1)(A); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532. There are\\n435 party candidates for House seats and 33 party candi\\xad\\ndates for Senate seats in any given election year. That\\nmakes an additional $2.4 million in allowable contribu\\xad\\ntions. Thus, without an aggregate limit, the law will\\npermit a wealthy individual to write a check, over a 2-year\\nelection cycle, for $3.6 million—all to benefit his political\\nparty and its candidates. See Appendix B, Table 2(a),\\ninfra, at 39.\\n   To make it easier for a wealthy donor to make a contri\\xad\\nbution of this size, the parties can simply enlarge the\\ncomposition of the Joint Party Committee described in\\nExample One, so that it now includes party candidates.\\nAnd a party can proliferate such joint entities, perhaps\\ncalling the first the “Smith Victory Committee,” the second\\nthe “Jones Victory Committee,” and the like. See 11 CFR\\n§102.17(c)(5) (2012). (I say “perhaps” because too trans\\xad\\nparent a name might call into play certain earmarking\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U.

But the Federal Election Commission’s (FEC)\\ndatabase of joint fundraising committees in 2012 shows\\nsimilarly named entities, e.g., “Landrieu Wyden Victory\\nFund,” etc.).\\n   As I have just said, without any aggregate limit, the law\\nwill allow Rich Donor to write a single check to, say, the\\nSmith Victory Committee, for up to $3.6 million. This\\ncheck represents “the total amount that the contributor\\ncould contribute to all of the participants” in the Commit\\xad\\ntee over a 2-year cycle. §102.17(c)(5). The Committee\\nwould operate under an agreement that provides a “for-\\nmula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds” among its\\nconstituent units. §102.17(c)(1). And that “formula”\\nwould divide the proceeds so that no committee or can-\\ndidate receives more than it could have received from\\nRich Donor directly—$64,800, $20,000, or $5,200. See\\n§102.17(c)(6).\\n   So what is wrong with that? The check is considerably\\nlarger than Example One’s check. But is there anything\\nelse wrong? The answer is yes, absolutely. The law will\\nalso permit a party and its candidates to shift most of Rich\\nDonor’s contributions to a single candidate, say Smith.\\nHere is how:\\n   The law permits each candidate and each party commit\\xad\\ntee in the Smith Victory Committee to write Candidate\\nSmith a check directly. For his primary and general\\nelections combined, they can write checks of up to $4,000\\n(from each candidate’s authorized campaign committee)\\nand $10,000 (from each state and national committee). \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"volume\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e\\n\u003cspan class\u003d\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"page\"\u003eC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class\u003d\"inline\"\u003e. §§432(e)(3)(B), 441a(a)(2)(A); 11 CFR §110.3(b).\\nThis yields a potential $1,872,000 (from candidates) plus\\n$530,000 (from party committees). Thus, the law permits\\nthe candidates and party entities to redirect $2.37 million\\nof Rich Donor’s $3.6 million check to Candidate Smith. It\\nalso permits state and national committees to contribute\\nto Smith’s general election campaign through making\\n\\x0c18      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\ncoordinated expenditures—in amounts that range from\\n$46,600 to $2.68 million for a general election (depending\\nupon the size of Smith’s State and whether he is running\\nfor a House or Senate seat). 78 Fed. Reg. 8530–8532. See\\nAppendix B, Table 2(b), infra, at 40.\\n   The upshot is that Candidate Smith can receive at least\\n$2.37 million and possibly the full $3.6 million contributed\\nby Rich Donor to the Smith Victory Committee, even\\nthough the funds must first be divided up among the\\nconstituent units before they can be rerouted to Smith.\\nNothing requires the Smith Victory Committee to explain\\nin advance to Rich Donor all of the various transfers that\\nwill take place, and nothing prevents the entities in the\\nCommittee from informing the donor and the receiving\\ncandidate after the fact what has transpired. Accordingly,\\nthe money can be donated and rerouted to Candidate\\nSmith without the donor having violated the base limits\\nor any other FEC regulation. And the evidence in the\\nMcConnell record reprinted in Appendix A, infra—with\\nrespect to soft money contributions—makes clear that\\nCandidate Smith will almost certainly come to learn from\\nwhom he has received this money.\\n   The parties can apply the same procedure to other large\\ndonations, channeling money from Rich Donor Two to\\nCandidate Jones. If 10 or 20 candidates face particularly\\ntight races, party committees and party candidates may\\nwork together to channel Rich Donor One’s multimillion\\ndollar contribution to the Most Embattled Candidate (e.g.,\\nCandidate Smith), Rich Donor Two’s multimillion dollar\\ncontribution to the Second Most Embattled Candidate\\n(e.g., Candidate Jones), and so on down the line. If this\\ndoes not count as evasion of the base limits, what does?\\nPresent aggregate limits confine the size of any individual\\ngift to $123,200.

It also prohibits (3) any PAC from contributing\\nmore than $10,000 to any candidate in an election cycle.\\n§441(a)(2)(A). But the law does not prohibit an individual\\nfrom contributing (within the current $123,200 biannual\\naggregate limit) $5,000 to each of an unlimited total num\\xad\\nber of PACs. And there, so to speak, lies the rub.\\n  Here is how, without any aggregate limits, a party will\\nbe able to channel $2 million from each of ten Rich Do-\\nnors to each of ten Embattled Candidates. Groups of party\\nsupporters—individuals, corporations, or trade unions—\\ncreate 200 PACs. Each PAC claims it will use the funds it\\nraises to support several candidates from the party,\\nthough it will favor those who are most endangered.\\n(Each PAC qualifies for “multicandidate” status because it\\nhas received contributions from more than 50 persons and\\nhas made contributions to five federal candidates at some\\npoint previously. §441a(a)(4); 11 CFR §100.5(e)(3)). Over\\na 2-year election cycle, Rich Donor One gives $10,000 to\\neach PAC ($5,000 per year)—yielding $2 million total.\\nRich Donor 2 does the same. So, too, do the other eight\\nRich Donors. This brings their total donations to $20\\nmillion, disbursed among the 200 PACs. Each PAC will\\nhave collected $100,000, and each can use its money to\\nwrite ten checks of $10,000—to each of the ten most Em\\xad\\nbattled Candidates in the party (over two years). See\\nAppendix B, Table 3, infra, at 41. Every Embattled Can\\xad\\ndidate, receiving a $10,000 check from 200 PACs, will\\nhave collected $2 million.\\n  The upshot is that ten Rich Donors will have contrib-\\nuted $2 million each, and ten Embattled Candidates will\\nhave collected $2 million each. In this example, unlike\\nExample Two, the recipient candidates may not know\\n\\x0c20      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nwhich of the ten Rich Donors is personally responsible for\\nthe $2 million he or she receives. But the recipient candi\\xad\\ndate is highly likely to know who the ten Rich Donors are,\\nand to feel appropriately grateful. Moreover, the ability of\\na small group of donors to contribute this kind of money to\\nthreatened candidates is not insignificant. In the example\\nabove—with ten Rich Donors giving $2 million each, and\\nten Embattled Candidates receiving $2 million each—the\\ncontributions would have been enough to finance a consid\\xad\\nerable portion of, and perhaps all of, the candidates’ races\\nin the 2012 elections. See Appendix C, Table 1, infra, at\\n42 (showing that in 2012, the average winning House\\ncandidate spent $1.6 million and the average winning\\nSenate candidate spent $11.5 million).\\n                              B\\n   The plurality believes that the three scenarios I have\\njust depicted either pose no threat, or cannot or will not\\ntake place. It does not believe the scenario depicted in\\nExample One is any cause for concern, because it involves\\nonly “general, broad-based support of a political party.”\\nAnte, at 37. Not so. A candidate who solicits a multimil\\xad\\nlion dollar check for his party will be deeply grateful to the\\ncheckwriter, and surely could reward him with a quid pro\\nquo favor. The plurality discounts the scenarios depicted\\nin Example Two and Example Three because it finds such\\ncircumvention tactics “illegal under current campaign\\nfinance laws,” “implausible,” or “divorced from reality.”\\nAnte, at 23, 24, 28. But they are not.\\n   The plurality’s view depends in large part upon its claim\\nthat since this Court decided Buckley in 1976, changes in\\neither statutory law or in applicable regulations have\\ncome to make it difficult, if not impossible, for these cir\\xad\\ncumvention scenarios to arise. Hence, it concludes, there\\nis no longer a need for aggregate contribution limits. See\\nante, at 11–13, 22–29. But a closer examination of the five\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U.

Ante, at 11; accord, 90 Stat. 487 (codified at \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"volume\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e\\n\u003cspan class\u003d\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"page\"\u003eC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class\u003d\"inline\"\u003e. §441a(a)(1)(C)). But Example Three, the here\\xad\\nrelevant example, takes account of those limits, namely,\\n$5,000 to a PAC in any given year. And it shows that the\\nper-PAC limit does not matter much when it comes to the\\npotential for circumvention, as long as party supporters\\ncan create dozens or hundreds of PACs. Federal law\\nplaces no upper limit on the number of PACs supporting a\\nparty or a group of party candidates that can be estab\\xad\\nlished. And creating a PAC is primarily a matter of pa\\xad\\nperwork, a knowledgeable staff person, and a little time.\\n   Second, the plurality points out that in 1976, Congress\\n“also added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors\\nfrom creating or controlling multiple affiliated political\\ncommittees.” Ante, at 12. The rule provides that “all\\ncontributions made by political committees established or\\nfinanced or maintained or controlled” by the same corpora\\xad\\ntion, labor organization, person, or group of persons, “shall\\nbe considered to have been made by a single political\\ncommittee.” §441a(a)(5). But different supporters can\\ncreate different PACs. Indeed, there were roughly 2,700\\n“nonconnected” PACs (i.e., PACs not connected to a spe-\\ncific corporation or labor union) operating during the 2012\\nelections. Ante, at 24. In a future without aggregate\\ncontribution limits, far more nonconnected PACs will\\nlikely appear. The plurality also notes that the FEC can\\nexamine certain “ ‘circumstantial factors,’ ” such as “ ‘com\\xad\\nmon or overlapping membership’ ” or “ ‘similar patterns of\\ncontributions,’ ” to determine whether a group of PACs are\\naffiliated. Ante, at 25 (quoting 11 CFR §100.5(g)(4)(ii)).\\n\\x0c22     MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nBut the ultimate question in the affiliation inquiry is\\nwhether “one committee or organization [has] been estab\\xad\\nlished, financed, maintain or controlled by another com\\xad\\nmittee or sponsoring organization.” Ibid. Just because a\\ngroup of multicandidate PACs all support the same party\\nand all decide to donate funds to a group of endangered\\ncandidates in that party does not mean they will qualify\\nas “affiliated” under the relevant definition. This rule\\nappears inadequate to stop the sort of circumvention\\ndepicted in Example Three.\\n   Third, the plurality says that a post-Buckley regulation\\nhas strengthened the statute’s earmarking provision.\\nAnte, at 12. Namely, the plurality points to a rule pro-\\nmulgated by the FEC in 1976, specifying that earmarking\\nincludes any “designation ‘whether direct or indirect,\\nexpress or implied, oral or written.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 11\\nCFR §110.6(b)); accord, 41 Fed. Reg. 35950 (1976). This\\nmeans that if Rich Donor were to give $5,000 to a PAC\\nwhile “designat[ing]” (in any way) that the money go to\\nCandidate Smith, those funds must count towards Rich\\nDonor’s total allowable contributions to Smith—$5,200 per\\nelection cycle. But the virtually identical earmarking\\nprovision in effect when this Court decided Buckley would\\nhave required the same thing. That provision also counted,\\nwhen applying the base contribution limits, “all contri-\\nbutions made by a person, either directly or indirectly, on\\nbehalf of a particular candidate, including contributions\\nwhich are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed\\nthrough an intermediary or conduit to a candidate.” 88\\nStat. 1264; accord, \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"volume\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"reporter\"\u003eU.S.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"page\"\u003eC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cpre class\u003d\"inline\"\u003e. §441a(a)(8) (same). What is\\nthe difference?\\n   Fourth, the plurality points out that the FEC’s regula\\xad\\ntions “specify that an individual who has contributed to a\\nparticular candidate committee may not also contribute to\\na single-candidate committee for that candidate.” Ante, at\\n12–13 (citing 11 CFR §110.1(h)(1); emphasis added). The\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           23\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nregulations, however, do not prevent a person who has\\ncontributed to a candidate from also contributing to multi-\\ncandidate committees that support the candidate. Indeed,\\nthe rules specifically authorize such contributions. See\\n§110.1(h) (“A person may contribute to a candidate . . . and\\nalso contribute to a political committee which has sup-\\nported, or anticipates supporting, the same candidate in\\nthe same election,” as long as the political committee is “not\\nthe candidate’s principal campaign committee” or a “single\\ncandidate committee” (emphasis added)). Example Three\\nillustrates the latter kind of contribution. And briefs\\nbefore us make clear that the possibility for circumventing\\nthe base limits through making such contributions is a\\nrealistic, not an illusory, one. See Brief for Appellee 36\\n(demonstrating that many PACs today explain in their\\npublic materials just what fairly small group of candidates\\nthey intend to support); Brief for Americans for Campaign\\nReform as Amicus Curiae 14–15 (similar).\\n   Fifth, the plurality points to another FEC regulation\\n(also added in 1976), which says that “an individual who\\nhas contributed to a candidate” may not “also contribute to\\na political committee that has supported or anticipates\\nsupporting the same candidate if the individual knows\\nthat ‘a substantial portion [of his contribution] will be\\ncontributed to, or expended on behalf of,’ that candidate.”\\nAnte, at 13 (quoting 11 CFR §110.1(h)(2); brackets in\\noriginal); accord, 41 Fed. Reg. 35948. This regulation is\\nimportant, for in principle, the FEC might use it to pre\\xad\\nvent the circumstances that Examples Two and Three set\\nforth from arising. And it is not surprising that the plu\\xad\\nrality relies upon the existence of this rule when it de\\xad\\nscribes those circumstances as “implausible,” “illegal,” or\\n“divorced from reality.” Ante, at 23, 24, 28.\\n   In fact, however, this regulation is not the strong anti\\xad\\ncircumvention weapon that the plurality imagines. De\\xad\\nspite the plurality’s assurances, it does not “disarm” the\\n\\x0c24      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\npossibilities for circumvention. Ante, at 23. That is be\\xad\\ncause the regulation requires a showing that donors have\\n“knowledge that a substantial portion” of their contribu\\xad\\ntions will be used by a PAC to support a candidate to\\nwhom they have already contributed. §110.1(h)(2) (em\\xad\\nphasis added). And “knowledge” is hard to prove.\\n   I have found nine FEC cases decided since the year 2000\\nthat refer to this regulation. In all but one, the FEC failed\\nto find the requisite “knowledge”—despite the presence of\\nExample Two or Example Three circumstances. See Fac\\xad\\ntual and Legal Analysis, In re: Transfund PAC, Matter\\nUnder Review (MUR) 6221, p. 11 (FEC, June 7, 2010)\\n(although the donor “might reasonably infer that some\\nportion of his contribution” to a candidate’s Leadership\\nPAC would be used to support the candidate, “such an\\ninference alone does not suggest that [he] had ‘actual\\nknowledge’ ” of such); Factual and Legal Analysis, In re:\\nJohn Shadegg’s Friends, MUR 5968, pp. 3, 6–7 (FEC, Nov.\\n10, 2008) (“[T]here is no basis on which to conclude that\\n[the donors] knew that the funds they contributed to\\nLEAD PAC would be used to support the Shadegg Com\\xad\\nmittee” even though Congressman Shadegg solicited the\\ndonations and LEAD PAC was Congressman Shadegg’s\\nLeadership PAC); Factual and Legal Analysis, In re: Wal-\\nberg for Congress, MUR 5881, pp. 6, 9–11 (FEC, Aug. 15,\\n2007) (finding seven contributors, who gave to a candidate\\nand to a PAC that provided 86% of the candidate’s financ\\xad\\ning, had not shown “knowledge”); Factual and Legal Anal\\xad\\nysis, In re: Matt Brown for Senate, MUR 5732, p. 11 (FEC,\\nApr. 4, 2007) (“Though it may be reasonable to infer that\\nthe individual donors solicited by Brown gave to the State\\nParties under the assumption that some portion of their\\ncontribution might then be donated to the Brown Commit\\xad\\ntee, such an inference alone is insufficient to find reason to\\nbelieve 11 CFR §110.1(h) has been violated”); First Gen\\xad\\neral Counsel’s Report, In re: Liffrig for Senate, MUR 5678,\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

Given this record of FEC\\n(in)activity, my reaction to the plurality’s reliance upon\\nagency enforcement of this rule (as an adequate substitute\\nfor Congress’ aggregate limits) is like Oscar Wilde’s after\\nreading Dickens’ account of the death of Little Nell: “One\\nmust have a heart of stone,” said Wilde, “to read [it] with\\xad\\nout laughing.” Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations\\n86 (N. Sherrin 2d ed. 2001).\\n   I have found one contrary example—the single example\\nto which the plurality refers.

In that case, the FEC found prob\\xad\\nable cause to believe that three individual contributors to\\nseveral PACs had the requisite “knowledge” that the PACs\\nwould use a “substantial portion” of their contributions to\\nsupport a candidate to whom they had already contributed—\\nSam Brownback, a candidate for the Senate (for two of\\nthe contributors), and Robert Riley, a candidate for the\\nHouse (for the third). The individuals had made donations\\nto several PACs operating as a network, under the direc\\xad\\ntion of a single political consulting firm. The two contribu\\xad\\ntors to Sam Brownback were his parents-in-law, and the\\nFEC believed they might be using the PAC network to\\nchannel extra support to him. The contributor to Robert\\nRiley was his son, and the FEC believed he might be doing\\nthe same. The facts in this case are unusual, for individ-\\nual contributors are not typically relatives of the candidates\\nthey are seeking to support, and ordinary PACs do not\\ntend to work in coordination under the direction of a con\\xad\\n\\x0c26     MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nsulting firm. In any event, this single swallow cannot\\nmake the plurality’s summer.\\n   Thus, it is not surprising that throughout the many\\nyears this FEC regulation has been in effect, political\\nparties and candidates have established ever more joint\\nfundraising committees (numbering over 500 in the last\\nfederal elections); candidates have established ever more\\n“Leadership PACs” (numbering over 450 in the last elec\\xad\\ntions); and party supporters have established ever more\\nmulticandidate PACs (numbering over 3,000 in the last\\nelections). See Appendix C, Tables 2–3, infra, at 42–43;\\nFEC, 2014 Committee Summary (reporting the number of\\n“qualified” (or multicandidate) PACs in 2012), online at\\nhttp://www.fec.gov/data/CommitteeSummary.do (all Inter\\xad\\nnet materials as visited Mar. 28, 2014, and available in\\nClerk of Court’s case file).\\n   Using these entities, candidates, parties, and party\\nsupporters can transfer and, we are told, have transferred\\nlarge sums of money to specific candidates, thereby avoid\\xad\\ning the base contribution limits in ways that Examples\\nTwo and Three help demonstrate. See Brief for Appellee\\n38–39, 53–54; Brief for Campaign Legal Center, et al. as\\nAmici Curiae 12–15; Brief of Democratic Members of the\\nUnited States House of Representatives as Amici Curiae\\n28–29. They have done so without drawing FEC prosecu\\xad\\ntion—at least not according to my (and apparently the\\nplurality’s) search of publicly available records. That is\\nlikely because in the real world, the methods of achieving\\ncircumvention are more subtle and more complex than our\\nstylized Examples Two and Three depict. And persons\\nhave used these entities to channel money to candidates\\nwithout any individual breaching the current aggregate\\n$123,200 limit. The plurality now removes that limit,\\nthereby permitting wealthy donors to make aggregate\\ncontributions not of $123,200, but of several millions of\\ndollars.

Ante, at 30. The First Amendment requires “ ‘a\\nfit that is . . . reasonable,’ ” and there is no such “fit” here\\nbecause there are several alternative ways Congress could\\nprevent evasion of the base limits. Ibid. (quoting Fox, 492\\nU. S., at 480). For instance, the plurality posits, Congress\\n(or the FEC) could “tighten . . . transfer rules”; it could\\nrequire “contributions above the current aggregate limits\\nto be deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts\\nand spent only by their recipients”; it could define “how\\nmany candidates a PAC must support in order to ensure\\nthat ‘a substantial portion’ of a donor’s contribution is not\\nrerouted to a certain candidate”; or it could prohibit “do\\xad\\nnors who have contributed the current maximum sums\\nfrom further contributing to political committees that have\\nindicated they will support candidates to whom the donor\\nhas already contributed.” Ante, at 33–35 (quoting 11 CFR\\n§110.1(h)(2)).\\n   The plurality, however, does not show, or try to show,\\nthat these hypothetical alternatives could effectively\\nreplace aggregate contribution limits. Indeed, it does not\\neven “opine on the validity of any particular proposal,”\\nante, at 35—presumably because these proposals them\\xad\\nselves could be subject to constitutional challenges. For\\nthe most part, the alternatives the plurality mentions\\nwere similarly available at the time of Buckley. Their\\nhypothetical presence did not prevent the Court from\\nupholding aggregate limits in 1976. How can their con\\xad\\ntinued hypothetical presence lead the plurality now to\\nconclude that aggregate limits are “poorly tailored?” See\\nante, at 30. How can their continued hypothetical pres\\xad\\nence lead the Court to overrule Buckley now?\\n\\x0c28      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\n  In sum, the explanation of why aggregate limits are\\nneeded is complicated, as is the explanation of why other\\nmethods will not work. But the conclusion is simple:\\nThere is no “substantial mismatch” between Congress’\\nlegitimate objective and the “means selected to achieve it.”\\nAnte, at 10. The Court, as in Buckley, should hold that\\naggregate contribution limits are constitutional.\\n                              V\\n   The District Court in this case, holding that Buckley\\nforeclosed McCutcheon’s constitutional challenge to the\\naggregate limits, granted the Government’s motion to\\ndismiss the complaint prior to a full evidentiary hearing.\\nSee \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"citation no-link\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"volume\"\u003e893\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"reporter\"\u003eF.

If the plu\\xad\\nrality now believes the District Court was wrong, then\\nwhy does it not return the case for the further evidentiary\\ndevelopment which has not yet taken place?\\n   In the past, when evaluating the constitutionality of\\ncampaign finance restrictions, we have typically relied\\nupon an evidentiary record amassed below to determine\\nwhether the law served a compelling governmental objec\\xad\\ntive. And, typically, that record contained testimony from\\nMembers of Congress (or state legislators) explaining why\\nCongress (or the legislature) acted as it did. See, e.g.,\\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 147–154 (upholding federal re\\xad\\nstrictions on soft money by drawing on an extensive Dis\\xad\\ntrict Court record that contained declarations from current\\nand former Members of Congress); Colorado II, 533 U. S.,\\nat 457–465 (upholding federal limits on coordinated ex\\xad\\npenditures between parties and candidates on the basis of\\na summary judgment record that contained declarations\\nfrom party operatives, fundraisers, and Members of Con\\xad\\ngress); Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 393 (upholding\\nMissouri’s contribution limits on the basis of the lower\\ncourt record, which contained similar declarations). If we\\nare to overturn an act of Congress here, we should do so on\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          29\\n\\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nthe basis of a similar record.\\n  For one thing, an evidentiary record can help us deter\\xad\\nmine whether or the extent to which we should defer to\\nCongress’ own judgments, particularly those reflecting a\\nbalance of the countervailing First Amendment interests\\nI have described. Determining whether anticorruption\\nobjectives justify a particular set of contribution limits\\nrequires answering empirically based questions, and ap-\\nplying significant discretion and judgment. To what ex\\xad\\ntent will unrestricted giving lead to corruption or its\\nappearance? What forms will any such corruption take?\\nTo what extent will a lack of regulation undermine public\\nconfidence in the democratic system? To what extent can\\nregulation restore it?\\n  These kinds of questions, while not easily answered, are\\nquestions that Congress is far better suited to resolve than\\nare judges. Thus, while court review of contribution limits\\nhas been and should be “rigorous,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at\\n29, we have also recognized that “deference to legislative\\nchoice is warranted.” Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 155. And\\nthat deference has taken account of facts and circum\\xad\\nstances set forth in an evidentiary record.\\n  For another thing, a comparison of the plurality’s opin\\xad\\nion with this dissent reveals important differences of\\nopinion on fact-related matters. We disagree, for example,\\non the possibilities for circumvention of the base limits in\\nthe absence of aggregate limits. We disagree about how\\neffectively the plurality’s “alternatives” could prevent\\nevasion. An evidentiary proceeding would permit the\\nparties to explore these matters, and it would permit the\\ncourts to reach a more accurate judgment. The plurality\\nrationalizes its haste to forgo an evidentiary record by\\nnoting that “the parties have treated the question as a\\npurely legal one.” Ante, at 14, n. 4. But without a doubt,\\nthe legal question—whether the aggregate limits are\\nclosely drawn to further a compelling governmental inter\\xad\\n\\x0c30      MCCUTCHEON v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nest—turns on factual questions about whether corruption,\\nin the absence of such limits, is a realistic threat to our\\ndemocracy. The plurality itself spends pages citing figures\\nabout campaign spending to defend its “legal” conclusion.\\nAnte, at 24–26, 27–28, 30–32. The problem with such\\nreasoning is that this Court’s expertise does not lie in\\nmarshaling facts in the primary instance. That is why in\\nthe past, when answering similar questions about the\\nconstitutionality of restrictions on campaign contributions,\\nwe have relied on an extensive evidentiary record pro\\xad\\nduced below to inform our decision.\\n   Without further development of the record, however, I\\nfail to see how the plurality can now find grounds for\\noverturning Buckley. The justification for aggregate con\\xad\\ntribution restrictions is strongly rooted in the need to\\nassure political integrity and ultimately in the First\\nAmendment itself. Part II, supra. The threat to that\\nintegrity posed by the risk of special access and influence\\nremains real. Part III, supra. Even taking the plurality\\non its own terms and considering solely the threat of quid\\npro quo corruption (i.e., money-for-votes exchanges), the\\naggregate limits are a necessary tool to stop circumven\\xad\\ntion. Ibid. And there is no basis for finding a lack of “fit”\\nbetween the threat and the means used to combat it,\\nnamely the aggregate limits. Part IV, supra.\\n   The plurality reaches the opposite conclusion. The re\\xad\\nsult, as I said at the outset, is a decision that substitutes\\njudges’ understandings of how the political process works\\nfor the understanding of Congress; that fails to recognize\\nthe difference between influence resting upon public opin\\xad\\nion and influence bought by money alone; that overturns\\nkey precedent; that creates huge loopholes in the law; and\\nthat undermines, perhaps devastates, what remains of\\ncampaign finance reform.\\n   With respect, I dissent.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 572 U.

But on the 26th of May his bail or surety in the recognisance delivered him to the marshal, in the presence of the commissioner, and requested the commissioner to recommit Booth to the custody of the marshal; and he having failed to recognise again for his appearance before the District Court, the commissioner committed him to the custody of the marshal, to be delivered to the keeper of the jail until he should be discharged by due course of law.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p4\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eBooth made application on the next day, the 27th of May, to A.

And on the 4th of December, Booth, the defendant in error, filed a memorandum in writing in this court, stating that he had been cited to appear here in this case, and that he submitted it to the judgment of this court on the reasoning in the argument and opinions in the printed pamphlets therewith sent.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p11\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eAfter the judgment was entered in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and before the writ of error was sued out, the State court entered on its record, that, in the final judgment it had rendered, the validity of the act of Congress of September 18, 1850, and of February 12, 1793, and the authority of the marshal to hold the defendant in his custody, under the process mentioned in his return to the writ of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, were respectively drawn in question, and the decision of the court in the final judgment was against their validity, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p12\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThis certificate was not necessary to give this court jurisdiction, because the proceedings upon their face show that these questions arose, and how they were decided; but it shows that at that time the Supreme Court of Wisconsin did not question their obligation to obey the writ of error, nor the authority of this court to re-examine their judgment in the cases specified.

At the January term of the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, after Booth had been set at liberty, and after the transcript of the proceedings in the case above mentioned had been returned to and filed in this court, the grand jury found a bill of indictment against Booth for the offence with which he was charged before the commissioner, and from which the State court had discharged him. The indictment was found on the 4th of January, 1855. On the 9th a motion was made, by counsel on behalf of the accused, to quash the indictment, which was overruled by the court; and he thereupon pleaded not guilty, upon which issue was joined. On the 10th a jury was called and appeared in court, when he challenged the array; but the challenge was overruled and the jury empanelled. The trial, it appears, continued from day to day, until the 13th, when the jury found him guilty in the manner and form in which he stood indicted in the fourth and fifth counts. On the 16th he moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, which motions were argued on the 20th, and on the 23d the court overruled the motions, and sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for one month, and to pay a fine of $1,000 and the costs of prosecution; and that he remain in custody until the sentence was complied with.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p14\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eWe have stated more particularly these proceedings, from a sense of justice to the District Court, as they show that every opportunity of making his defence was afforded him, and that his case was fully heard and considered.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p15\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eOn the 26th of January, three days after the sentence was passed, the prisoner by his counsel filed his petition in the Supreme Court of the State, and with his petition filed a copy of the proceedings in the District Court, and also affidavits from the foreman and one other member of the jury who tried him, stating that their verdict was, guilty on the fourth and fifth counts, and not guilty on the other three; and stated in his petition that his imprisonment was illegal, because the fugitive slave law was unconstitutional; that the District Court had no jurisdiction to try or punish him for the matter charged against him, and that the proceedings and sentence of that court were absolute nullities in law. Various other objections to the proceedings are alleged, which are unimportant in the questions now before the court, and need not, therefore, be particularly stated. On the next day, the 27th, the court directed two writs of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e to be issued\u0026#8212;one to the marshal, and one to the sheriff of Milwaukee, to whose actual keeping the prisoner was committed by the marshal, by order of the District Court. The \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e directed each of them to produce the body of the prisoner, and make known the cause of his imprisonment, immediately after the receipt of the writ.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p16\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eOn the 30th of January the marshal made his return, not acknowledging the jurisdiction, but stating the sentence of the District Court as his authority; that the prisoner was delivered to, and was then in the actual keeping of the sheriff of Milwaukee county, by order of the court, and he therefore had no control of the body of the prisoner; and if the sheriff had not received him, he should have so reported to the District Court, and should have conveyed him to some other place or prison, as the court should command.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p17\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eOn the same day the sheriff produced the body of Booth before the State court, and returned that he had been committed to his custody by the marshal, by virtue of a transcript, a true copy of which was annexed to his return, and which was the only process or authority by which he detained him.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p18\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThis transcript was a full copy of the proceedings and sentence in the District Court of the United States, as hereinbefore stated.

The writ of error was allowed and issued, and, according to the rules and practice of the court, was returnable on the first Monday of December, 1855, and a citation for the defendant in error to appear on that day was issued by the Chief Justice at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p21\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eNo return having been made to this writ, the Attorney General, on the 1st of February, 1856, filed affidavits, showing that the writ of error had been duly served on the clerk of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, at his office, on the 30th of May, 1855, and the citation served on the defendant in error on the 28th of June, in the same year. And also the affidavit of the district attorney of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, setting forth that when he served the writ of error upon the clerk, as above mentioned, he was informed by the clerk, and has also been informed by one of the justices of the Supreme Court, which released Booth, \\\u0027\u003ci\u003ethat the court had directed the clerk to make no return to the writ of error, and to enter no order upon the journals or records of the court concerning the same\u003c/i\u003e.\\\u0027 And, upon these proofs, the Attorney General moved the court for an order upon the clerk to make return to the writ of error, on or before the first day of the next ensuing term of this court. The rule was accordingly laid, and on the 22d of July, 1856, the Attorney General filed with the clerk of this court the affidavit of the marshal of the district of Wisconsin, that he had served the rule on the clerk on the 7th of the month above mentioned; and no return having been made, the Attorney General, on the 27th of February, 1857, moved for leave to file the certified copy of the record of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which he had produced with his application for the writ of error, and to docket the case in this court, in conformity with a motion to that effect made at the last term. And the court thereupon, on the 6th of March, 1857, ordered the copy of the record filed by the Attorney General to be received and entered on the docket of this court, to have the same effect and legal operation as if returned by the clerk with the writ of error, and that the case stand for argument at the next ensuing term, without further notice to either party.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p22\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe case was accordingly docketed, but was not reached for argument in the regular order and practice of the court until the present term.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p23\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThis detailed statement of the proceedings in the different courts has appeared to be necessary in order to form a just estimate of the action of the different tribunals in which it has been heard, and to account for the delay in the final decision of a case, which, from its character, would seem to have demanded prompt action. The first case, indeed, was reached for trial two terms ago. But as the two cases are different portions of the same prosecution for the same offence, they unavoidably, to some extent, involve the same principles of law, and it would hardly have been proper to hear and decide the first before the other was ready for hearing and decision. They have accordingly been argued together, by the Attorney General of the United States, at the present term. No counsel has in either case appeared for the defendant in error. But we have the pamphlet arguments filed and referred to by Booth in the first case, as hereinbefore mentioned, also the opinions and arguments of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and of the judges who compose it, in full, and are enabled, therefore, to see the grounds on which they rely to support their decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p24\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIt will be seen, from the foregoing statement of facts, that a judge of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin in the first of these cases, claimed and exercised the right to supervise and annul the proceedings of a commissioner of the United States, and to discharge a prisoner, who had been committed by the commissioner for an offence against the laws of this Government, and that this exercise of power by the judge was afterwards sanctioned and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p25\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIn the second case, the State court has gone a step further, and claimed and exercised jurisdiction over the proceedings and judgment of a District Court of the United States, and upon a summary and collateral proceeding, by \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, has set aside and annulled its judgment, and discharged a prisoner who had been tried and found guilty of an offence against the laws of the United States, and sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p26\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eAnd it further appears that the State court have not only claimed and exercised this jurisdiction, but have also determined that their decision is final and conclusive upon all the courts of the United States, and ordered their clerk to disregard and refuse obedience to the writ of error issued by this court, pursuant to the act of Congress of 1789, to bring here for examination and revision the judgment of the State court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p27\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThese propositions are new in the jurisprudence of the United States, as well as of the States; and the supremacy of the State courts over the courts of the United States, in cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, is now for the first time asserted and acted upon in the Supreme Court of a State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p28\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe supremacy is not, indeed, set forth distinctly and broadly, in so many words, in the printed opinions of the judges.

But the paramount power of the State court lies at the foundation of these decisions; for their commentaries upon the provisions of that law, and upon the privileges and power of the writ of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, were out of place, and their judicial action upon them without authority of law, unless they had the power to revise and control the proceedings in the criminal case of which they were speaking; and their judgments, releasing the prisoner, and disregarding the writ of error from this court, can rest upon no other foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p29\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIf the judicial power exercised in this instance has been reserved to the States, no offence against the laws of the United States can be punished by their own courts, without the permission and according to the judgment of the courts of the State in which the party happens to be imprisoned; for, if the Supreme Court of Wisconsin possessed the power it has exercised in relation to offences against the act of Congress in question, it necessarily follows that they must have the same judicial authority in relation to any other law of the United States; and, consequently, their supervising and controlling power would embrace the whole criminal code of the United States, and extend to offences against our revenue laws, or any other law intended to guard the different departments of the General Government from fraud or violence. And it would embrace all crimes, from the highest to the lowest; including felonies, which are punished with death, as well as misdemeanors, which are punished by imprisonment. And, moreover, if the power is possessed by the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin, it must belong equally to every other State in the Union, when the prisoner is within its territorial limits; and it is very certain that the State courts would not always agree in opinion; and it would often happen, that an act which was admitted to be an offence, and justly punished, in one State, would be regarded as innocent, and indeed as praiseworthy, in another.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p30\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIt would seem to be hardly necessary to do more than state the result to which these decisions of the State courts must inevitably lead. It is, of itself, a sufficient and conclusive answer; for no one will suppose that a Government which has now lasted nearly seventy years, enforcing its laws by its own tribunals, and preserving the union of the States, could have lasted a single year, or fulfilled the high trusts committed to it, if offences against its laws could not have been punished without the consent of the State in which the culprit was found.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p31\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe judges of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin do not distinctly state from what source they suppose they have derived this judicial power. There can be no such thing as judicial authority, unless it is conferred by a Government or sovereignty; and if the judges and courts of Wisconsin possess the jurisdiction they claim, they must derive it either from the United States or the State. It certainly has not been conferred on them by the United States; and it is equally clear it was not in the power of the State to confer it, even if it had attempted to do so; for no State can authorize one of its judges or courts to exercise judicial power, by \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e or otherwise, within the jurisdiction of another and independent Government. And although the State of Wisconsin is sovereign within its territorial limits to a certain extent, yet that sovereignty is limited and restricted by the Constitution of the United States. And the powers of the General Government, and of the State, although both exist and are exercised within the same territorial limits, are yet separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres. And the sphere of action appropriated to the United States is as far beyond the reach of the judicial process issued by a State judge or a State court, as if the line of division was traced by landmarks and monuments visible to the eye. And the State of Wisconsin had no more power to authorize these proceedings of its judges and courts, than it would have had if the prisoner had been confined in Michigan, or in any other State of the Union, for an offence against the laws of the State in which he was imprisoned.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p32\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIt is, however, due to the State to say, that we do not find this claim of paramount jurisdiction in the State courts over the courts of the United States asserted or countenanced by the Constitution or laws of the State.

The Constitution was not formed merely to guard the States against danger from foreign nations, but mainly to secure union and harmony at home; for if this object could be attained, there would be but little danger from abroad; and to accomplish this purpose, it was felt by the statesmen who framed the Constitution, and by the people who adopted it, that it was necessary that many of the rights of sovereighty which the States then possessed should be ceded to the General Government; and that, in the sphere of action assigned to it, it should be supreme, and strong enough to execute its own laws by its own tribunals, without interruption from a State or from State authorities. And it was evident that anything short of this would be inadequate to the main objects for which the Government was established; and that local interests, local passions or prejudices, incited and fostered by individuals for sinister purposes, would lead to acts of aggression and injustice by one State upon the rights of another, which would ultimately terminate in violence and force, unless there was a common arbiter between them, armed with power enough to protect and guard the rights of all, by appropriate laws, to be carried into execution peacefully by its judicial tribunals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p37\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e37\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe language of the Constitution, by which this power is granted, is too plain to admit of doubt or to need comment. It declares that \\\u0027this Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be passed in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\\\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p38\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e38\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eBut the supremacy thus conferred on this Government could not peacefully be maintained, unless it was clothed with judicial power, equally paramount in authority to carry it into execution; for if left to the courts of justice of the several States, conflicting decisions would unavoidably take place, and the local tribunals could hardly be expected to be always free from the local influences of which we have spoken. And the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, and the powers granted to the Federal Government, would soon receive different interpretations in different States, and the Government of the United States would soon become one thing in one State and another thing in another. It was essential, therefore, to its very existence as a Government, that it should have the power of establishing courts of justice, altogether independent of State power, to carry into effect its own laws; and that a tribunal should be established in which all cases which might arise under the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, whether in a State court or a court of the United States, should be finally and conclusively decided. Without such a tribunal, it is obvious that there would be no uniformity of judicial decision; and that the supremacy, (which is but another name for independence,) so carefully provided in the clause of the Constitution above referred to, could not possibly be maintained peacefully, unless it was associated with this paramount judicial authority.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p39\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e39\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eAccordingly, it was conferred on the General Government, in clear, precise, and comprehensive terms. It is declared that its judicial power shall (among other subjects enumerated) extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that in such cases, as well as the others there enumerated, this court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as Congress shall make. The appellate power, it will be observed, is conferred on this court in all cases or suits in which such a question shall arise. It is not confined to suits in the inferior courts of the United States, but extends to all cases where such a question arises, whether it be in a judicial tribunal of a State or of the United States. And it is manifest that this ultimate appellate power in a tribunal created by the Constitution itself was deemed essential to secure the independence and supremacy of the General Government in the sphere of action assigned to it; to make the Constitution and laws of the United States uniform, and the same in every State; and to guard against evils which would inevitably arise from conflicting opinions between the courts of a State and of the United States, if there was no common arbiter authorized to decide between them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p40\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e40\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe importance which the framers of the Constitution attached to such a tribunal, for the purpose of preserving internal tranquillity, is strikingly manifested by the clause which gives this court jurisdiction over the sovereign States which compose this Union, when a controversy arises between them. Instead of reserving the right to seek redress for injustice from another State by their sovereign powers, they have bound themselves to submit to the decision of this court, and to abide by its judgment. And it is not out of place to say, here, that experience has demonstrated that this power was not unwisely surrendered by the States; for in the time that has already elapsed since this Government came into existence, several irritating and angry controversies have taken place between adjoining States, in relation to their respective boundaries, and which have sometimes threatened to end in force and violence, but for the power vested in this court to hear them and decide between them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p41\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e41\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe same purposes are clearly indicated by the different language employed when conferring supremacy upon the laws of the United States, and jurisdiction upon its courts. In the first case, it provides that \\\u0027this Constitution, and the laws of the United States \u003ci\u003ewhich shall be made in pursuance thereof\u003c/i\u003e, shall be the supreme law of the land, and obligatory upon the judges in every State.\\\u0027 The words in italics show the precision and foresight which marks every clause in the instrument. The sovereignty to be created was to be limited in its powers of legislation, and if it passed a law not authorized by its enumerated powers, it was not to be regarded as the supreme law of the land, nor were the State judges bound to carry it into execution. And as the courts of a State, and the courts of the United States, might, and indeed certainly would, often differ as to the extent of the powers conferred by the General Government, it was manifest that serious controversies would arise between the authorities of the United States and of the States, which must be settled by force of arms, unless some tribunal was created to decide between them finally and with out appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p42\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e42\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe Constitution has accordingly provided, as far as human foresight could provide, against this danger. And in conferring judicial power upon the Federal Government, it declares that the jurisdiction of its courts shall extend to all cases arising under \\\u0027this Constitution\\\u0027 and the laws of the United States\u0026#8212;leaving out the words of restriction contained in the grant of legislative power which we have above noticed. The judicial power covers every legislative act of Congress, whether it be made within the limits of its delegated powers, or be an assumption of power beyond the grants in the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p43\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e43\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThis judicial power was justly regarded as indispensable, not merely to maintain the supremacy of the laws of the United States, but also to guard the States from any encroachment upon their reserved rights by the General Government. And as the Constitution is the fundamental and supreme law, if it appears that an act of Congress is not pursuant to and within the limits of the power assigned to the Federal Government, it is the duty of the courts of the United States to declare it unconstitutional and void. The grant of judicial power is not confined to the administration of laws passed in pursuance to the provisions of the Constitution, nor confined to the interpretation of such laws; but, by the very terms of the grant, the Constitution is under their view when any act of Congress is brought before them, and it is their duty to declare the law void, and refuse to execute it, if it is not pursuant to the legislative powers conferred upon Congress. And as the final appellate power in all such questions is given to this court, controversies as to the respective powers of the United States and the States, instead of being determined by military and physical force, are heard, investigated, and finally settled, with the calmness and deliberation of judicial inquiry. And no one can fail to see, that if such an arbiter had not been provided, in our complicated system of government, internal tranquillity could not have been preserved; and if such controver sies were left to arbitrament of physical force, our Government, State and National, would soon cease to be Governments of laws, and revolutions by force of arms would take the place of courts of justice and judicial decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p44\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e44\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIn organizing such a tribunal, it is evident that every precaution was taken, which human wisdom could devise, to fit it for the high duty with which it was intrusted. It was not left to Congress to create it by law; for the States could hardly be expected to confide in the impartiality of a tribunal created exclusively by the General Government, without any participation on their part. And as the performance of its duty would sometimes come in conflict with individual ambition or interests, and powerful political combinations, an act of Congress establishing such a tribunal might be repealed in order to establish another more subservient to the predominant political influences or excited passions of the day. This tribunal, therefore, was erected, and the powers of which we have spoken conferred upon it, not by the Federal Government, but by the people of the States, who formed and adopted that Government, and conferred upon it all the powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, which it now possesses. And in order to secure its independence, and enable it faithfully and firmly to perform its duty, it engrafted it upon the Constitution itself, and declared that this court should have appellate power in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. So long, therefore, as this Constitution shall endure, this tribunal must exist with it, deciding in the peaceful forms of judicial proceeding the angry and irritating controversies between sovereignties, which in other countries have been determined by the arbitrament of force.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p45\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e45\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThese principles of constitutional law are confirmed and illustrated by the clause which confers legislative power upon Congress.

And in the performance of this duty, the First Congress, at its first session, passed the act of 1789, ch. 20, entitled \\\u0027\u003ci\u003eAn act to establish the judicial courts of the United States\u003c/i\u003e.\\\u0027 It will be remembered that many of the members of the Convention were also members of this Congress, and it cannot be supposed that they did not understand the meaning and intention of the great instrument which they had so anxiously and deliberately considered, clause by clause, and assisted to frame. And the law they passed to carry into execution the powers vested in the judicial department of the Government proves, past doubt, that their interpretation of the appellate powers conferred on this court was the same with that which we have now given; for by the 25th section of the act of 1789, Congress authorized writs of error to be issued from this court to a State court, whenever a right had been claimed under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and the decision of the State court was against it. And to make this appellate power effectual, and altogether independent of the action of State tribunals, this act further provides, that upon writs of error to a State court, instead of remanding the cause for a final decision in the State court, this court may at their discretion, if the cause shall have been once remanded before, proceed to a final decision of the same, and award execution.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p48\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e48\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThese provisions in the act of 1789 tell us, in language not to be mistaken, the great importance which the patriots and statement of the First Congress attached to this appellate power, and the foresight and care with which they guarded its free and independent exercise against interference or obstruction by States or State tribunals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p49\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e49\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIn the case before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, a right was claimed under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and the decision was against the right claimed; and it refuses obedience to the writ of error, and regards its own judgment as final. It has not only reversed and annulled the judgment of the District Court of the United States, but it has reversed and annulled the provisions of the Constitution itself, and the act of Congress of 1789, and made the superior and appellate tribunal the inferior and subordinate one.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p50\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e50\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eWe do not question the authority of State court, or judge, who is authorized by the laws of the State to issue the writ of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, to issue it in any case where the party is imprisoned within its territorial limits, provided it does not appear, when the application is made, that the person imprisoned is in custody under the authority of the United States. The court or judge has a right to inquire, in this mode of proceeding, for what cause and by what authority the prisoner is confined within the territorial limits of the State sovereignty. And it is the duty of the marshal, or other person having the custody of the prisoner, to make known to the judge or court, by a proper return, the authority by which he holds him in custody. This right to inquire by process of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, and the duty of the officer to make a return, a grows, necessarily, out of the complex character of our Government, and the existence of two distinct and separate sovereignties within the same territorial space, each of them restricted in its powers, and each within its sphere of action, prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, independent of the other. But, after the return is made, and the State judge or court judicially apprized that the party is in custody under the authority of the United States, they can proceed no further. They then know that the prisoner is within the dominion and jurisdiction of another Government, and that neither the writ of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, nor any other process issued under State authority, can pass over the line of division between the two sovereignties. He is then within the dominion and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. If he has committed an offence against their laws, their tribunals alone can punish him. If he is wrongfully imprisoned, their judicial tribunals can release him and afford him redress. And although, as we have said, it is the duty of the marshal, or other person holding him, to make known, by a proper return, the authority under which he detains him, it is at the same time imperatively his duty to obey the process of the United States, to hold the prisoner in custody under it, and to refuse obedience to the mandate or process of any other Government. And consequently it is his duty not to take the prisoner, nor suffer him to be taken, before a State judge or court upon a \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e issued under State authority. No State judge or court, after they are judicially informed that the party is imprisoned under the authority of the United States, has any right to interfere with him, or to require him to be brought before them. And if the authority of a State, in the form of judicial process or otherwise, should attempt to control the marshal or other authorized officer or agent of the United States, in any respect, in the custody of his prisoner, it would be his duty to resist it, and to call to his aid any force that might be necessary to maintain the authority of law against illegal interference. No judicial process, whatever form it may assume, can have any lawful authority outside of the limits of the jurisdiction of the court or judge by whom it is issued; and an attempt to enforce it beyond these boundaries is nothing less than lawless violence.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p51\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e51\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eNor is there anything in this supremacy of the General Government, or the jurisdiction of its judicial tribunals, to awaken the jealousy or offend the natural and just pride of State sovereignty. Neither this Government, nor the powers of which we are speaking, were forced upon the States. The Constitution of the United States, with all the powers conferred by it on the General Government, and surrendered by the States, was the voluntary act of the people of the several States, deliberately done, for their own protection and safety against injustice from one another. And their anxiety to preserve it in full force, in all its powers, and to guard against resistance to or evasion of its authority, on the part of a State, is proved by the clause which requires that the members of the State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers of the several States, (as well as those of the General Government,) shall be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution. This is the last and closing clause of the Constitution, and inserted when the whole frame of Government, with the powers hereinbefore specified, had been adopted by the Convention; and it was in that form, and with these powers, that the Constitution was submitted to the people of the several States, for their consideration and decision.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p52\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e52\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eNow, it certainly can be no humiliation to the citizen of a republic to yield a ready obedience to the laws as administered by the constituted authorities. On the contrary, it is among his first and highest duties as a citizen, because free government cannot exist without it. Nor can it be inconsistent with the dignity of a sovereign State to observe faithfully, and in the spirit of sincerity and truth, the compact into which it voluntarily entered when it became a State of this Union. On the contrary, the highest honor of sovereignty is untarnished faith. And certainly no faith could be more deliberately and solemnly pledged than that which every State has plighted to the other States to support the Constitution as it is, in all its provisions, until they shall be altered in the manner which the Constitution itself prescribes. In the emphatic language of the pledge required, it is \u003ci\u003eto support this Constitution\u003c/i\u003e. And no power is more clearly conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States, than the power of this court to decide, ultimately and finally, all cases arising under such Constitution and laws; and for that purpose to bring here for revision, by writ of error, the judgment of a State court, where such questions have arisen, and the right claimed under them denied by the highest judicial tribunal in the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p53\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e53\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eWe are sensible that we have extended the examination of these decisions beyond the limits required by any intrinsic difficulty in the questions. But the decisions in question were made by the supreme judicial tribunal of the State; and when a court so elevated in its position has pronounced a judgment which, if it could be maintained, would subvert the very foundations of this Government, it seemed to be the duty of this court, when exercising its appellate power, to show plainly the grave errors into which the State court has fallen, and the consequences to which they would inevitably lead.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p54\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e54\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eBut it can hardly be necessary to point out the errors which followed their mistaken view of the jurisdiction they might lawfully exercise; because, if there was any defect of power in the commissioner, or in his mode of proceeding, it was for the tribunals of the United States to revise and correct it, and not for a State court. And as regards the decision of the District Court, it had exclusive and final jurisdiction by the laws of the United States; and neither the regularity of its proceedings nor the validity of its sentence could be called in question in any other court, either of a State or the United States, by \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e or any other process.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p55\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e55\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eBut although we think it unnecessary to discuss these questions, yet, as they have been decided by the State court, and are before us on the record, and we are not willing to be misunderstood, it is proper to say that, in the judgment of this court, the act of Congress commonly called the fugitive slave law is, in all of its provisions, fully authorized by the Constitution of the United States; that the commissioner had lawful authority to issue the warrant and commit the party, and that his proceedings were regular and conformable to law. We have already stated the opinion and judgment of the court as to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court, and the appellate powers which this court is authorized and required to exercise. And if any argument was needed to show the wisdom and necessity of this appellate power, the cases before us sufficiently prove it, and at the same time emphatically call for its exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p56\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e56\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin must therefore be reversed in each of the cases now before the court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u0027,\n",

On that account, they have been argued and considered together; and the following are the facts as they appear in the transcripts before us:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSherman M. Booth was charged before Winfield Smith, a commissioner duly appointed by the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, with having, on the 11th day of March, 1854, aided and abetted, at Milwaukee, in the said district, the escape of a fugitive slave from the deputy marshal, who had him in custody under a warrant issued by the district judge of the United States for that district, under the act of Congress of September 18, 1850.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUpon the examination before the commissioner, he was satisfied that an offence had been committed as charged, and that there was probable cause to believe that Booth had been guilty of it; and thereupon held him to bail to appear and answer before the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, on the first Monday in July then next ensuing. But on the 26th of May his bail or surety in the recognisance delivered him to the marshal, in the presence of the commissioner, and requested the commissioner to recommit Booth to the custody of the marshal, and he having failed to recognise again for his appearance before the District Court, the commissioner committed him to the custody of the marshal, to be delivered to the keeper of the jail until he should be discharged by due course of law.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBooth made application on the next day, the 27th of May, \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*508\u003c/span\u003e to A.D. Smith, one of the justices of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin, for a writ of habeas corpus, stating that he was restrained of his liberty by Stephen V.R. Ableman, marshal of the United States for that district, under the warrant of commitment hereinbefore mentioned; and alleging that his imprisonment was illegal, because the act of Congress of September 18, 1850, was unconstitutional and void; and also that the warrant was defective, and did not describe the offence created by that act, even if the act were valid.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUpon this application, the justice, on the same day, issued the writ of habeas corpus, directed to the marshal, requiring him forthwith to have the body of Booth before him, (the said justice,) together with the time and cause of his imprisonment. The marshal thereupon, on the day above mentioned, produced Booth, and made his return, stating that he was received into his custody as marshal on the day before, and held in custody by virtue of the warrant of the commissioner above mentioned, a copy of which he annexed to and returned with the writ.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTo this return Booth demurred, as not sufficient in law to justify his detention. And upon the hearing the justice decided that his detention was illegal, and ordered the marshal to discharge him and set him at liberty, which was accordingly done.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfterwards, on the 9th of June, in the same year, the marshal applied to the Supreme Court of the State for a certiorari, setting forth in his application the proceedings hereinbefore mentioned, and charging that the release of Booth by the justice was erroneous and unlawful, and praying that his proceedings might be brought before the Supreme Court of the State for revision.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe certiorari was allowed on the same day; and the writ was accordingly issued on the 12th of the same month, and returnable on the third Tuesday of the month; and on the 20th the return was made by the justice, stating the proceedings, as hereinbefore mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe case was argued before the Supreme Court of the State, and on the 19th of July it pronounced its judgment, affirming \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*509\u003c/span\u003e the decision of the associate justice discharging Booth from imprisonment, with costs against Ableman, the marshal.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfterwards, on the 26th of October, the marshal sued out a writ of error, returnable to this court on the first Monday of December, 1854, in order to bring the judgment here for revision; and the defendant in error was regularly cited to appear on that day; and the record and proceedings were certified to this court by the clerk of the State court in the usual form, in obedience to the writ of error. And on the 4th of December, Booth, the defendant in error, filed a memorandum in writing in this court, stating that he had been cited to appear here in this case, and that he submitted it to the judgment of this court on the reasoning in the argument and opinions in the printed pamphlets therewith sent.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the judgment was entered in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and before the writ of error was sued out, the State court entered on its record, that, in the final judgment it had rendered, the validity of the act of Congress of September 18, 1850, and of February 12, 1793, and the authority of the marshal to hold the defendant in his custody, under the process mentioned in his return to the writ of habeas corpus, were respectively drawn in question, and the decision of the court in the final judgment was against their validity, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis certificate was not necessary to give this court jurisdiction, because the proceedings upon their face show that these questions arose, and how they were decided; but it shows that at that time the Supreme Court of Wisconsin did not question their obligation to obey the writ of error, nor the authority of this court to re-examine their judgment in the cases specified. And the certificate is given for the purpose of placing distinctly on the record the points that were raised and decided in that court, in order that this court might have no difficulty in exercising its appellate power, and pronouncing its judgment upon all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe come now to the second case. At the January term of the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, after Booth had been set at liberty, and after the transcript of the proceedings in the case above mentioned had been \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*510\u003c/span\u003e returned to and filed in this court, the grand jury found a bill of indictment against Booth for the offence with which he was charged before the commissioner, and from which the State court had discharged him. The indictment was found on the 4th of January, 1855. On the 9th a motion was made, by counsel on behalf of the accused, to quash the indictment, which was overruled by the court; and he thereupon pleaded not guilty, upon which issue was joined. On the 10th a jury was called and appeared in court, when he challenged the array; but the challenge was overruled and the jury empanelled. The trial, it appears, continued from day to day, until the 13th, when the jury found him guilty in the manner and form in which he stood indicted in the fourth and fifth counts. On the 16th he moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, which motions were argued on the 20th, and on the 23d the court overruled the motions, and sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for one month, and to pay a fine of $1,000 and the costs of prosecution; and that he remain in custody until the sentence was complied with.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe have stated more particularly these proceedings, from a sense of justice to the District Court, as they show that every opportunity of making his defence was afforded him, and that his case was fully heard and considered.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the 26th of January, three days after the sentence was passed, the prisoner by his counsel filed his petition in the Supreme Court of the State, and with his petition filed a copy of the proceedings in the District Court, and also affidavits from the foreman and one other member of the jury who tried him, stating that their verdict was, guilty on the fourth and fifth counts, and not guilty on the other three; and stated in his petition that his imprisonment was illegal, because the fugitive slave law was unconstitutional; that the District Court had no jurisdiction to try or punish him for the matter charged against him, and that the proceedings and sentence of that court were absolute nullities in law. Various other objections to the proceedings are alleged, which are unimportant in the questions now before the court, and need not, therefore, be particularly stated. On the next day, the 27th, the court directed \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*511\u003c/span\u003e two writs of habeas corpus to be issued \\x97 one to the marshal, and one to the sheriff of Milwaukee, to whose actual keeping the prisoner was committed by the marshal, by order of the District Court. The habeas corpus directed each of them to produce the body of the prisoner, and make known the cause of his imprisonment, immediately after the receipt of the writ.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the 30th of January the marshal made his return, not acknowledging the jurisdiction, but stating the sentence of the District Court as his authority; that the prisoner was delivered to, and was then in the actual keeping of the sheriff of Milwaukee county, by order of the court, and he therefore had no control of the body of the prisoner; and if the sheriff had not received him, he should have so reported to the District Court, and should have conveyed him to some other place or prison, as the court should command.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the same day the sheriff produced the body of Booth before the State court, and returned that he had been committed to his custody by the marshal, by virtue of a transcript, a true copy of which was annexed to his return, and which was the only process or authority by which he detained him.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis transcript was a full copy of the proceedings and sentence in the District Court of the United States, as hereinbefore stated. To this return the accused, by his counsel, filed a general demurrer.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe court ordered the hearing to be postponed until the 2d of February, and notice to be given to the district attorney of the United States. It was accordingly heard on that day, and on the next, (February 3d,) the court decided that the imprisonment was illegal, and ordered and adjudged that Booth be, and he was by that judgment, forever discharged from that imprisonment and restraint, and he was accordingly set at liberty.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the 21st of April next following, the Attorney General of the United States presented a petition to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, stating briefly the facts in the case, and at the same time presenting an exemplification of the proceedings hereinbefore stated, duly certified by the clerk of the State court, and averring in his petition that the State court had no \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*512\u003c/span\u003e jurisdiction in the case, and praying that a writ of error might issue to bring its judgment before this court to correct the error. The writ of error was allowed and issued, and, according to the rules and practice of the court, was returnable on the first Monday of December, 1855, and a citation for the defend ant in error to appear on that day was issued by the Chief Justice at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNo return having been made to this writ, the Attorney General, on the 1st of February, 1856, filed affidavits, showing that the writ of error had been duly served on the clerk of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, at his office, on the 30th of May, 1855, and the citation served on the defendant in error on the 28th of June, in the same year. And also the affidavit of the district attorney of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, setting forth that when he served the writ of error upon the clerk, as above mentioned, he was informed by the clerk, and has also been informed by one of the justices of the Supreme Court, which released Booth, \"that the court had directed the clerk to make no return to the writ of error, and to enter no order upon the journals or records of the court concerning the same.\" And, upon these proofs, the Attorney General moved the court for an order upon the clerk to make return to the writ of error, on or before the first day of the next ensuing term of this court. The rule was accordingly laid, and on the 22d of July, 1856, the Attorney General filed with the clerk of this court the affidavit of the marshal of the district of Wisconsin, that he had served the rule on the clerk on the 7th of the month above mentioned; and no return having been made, the Attorney General, on the 27th of February, 1857, moved for leave to file the certified copy of the record of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which he had produced with his application for the writ of error, and to docket the case in this court, in conformity with a motion to that effect made at the last term. And the court thereupon, on the 6th of March, 1857, ordered the copy of the record filed by the Attorney General to be received and entered on the docket of this court, to have the same effect and legal operation as if returned by the clerk with the writ of error, and that the case stand for argument \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*513\u003c/span\u003e at the next ensuing term, without further notice to either party.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe case was accordingly docketed, but was not reached for argument in the regular order and practice of the court until the present term.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis detailed statement of the proceedings in the different courts has appeared to be necessary in order to form a just estimate of the action of the different tribunals in which it has been heard, and to account for the delay in the final decision of a case, which, from its character, would seem to have demanded prompt action. The first case, indeed, was reached for trial two terms ago. But as the two cases are different portions of the same prosecution for the same offence, they unavoidably, to some extent, involve the same principles of law, and it would hardly have been proper to hear and decide the first before the other was ready for hearing and decision. They have accordingly been argued together, by the Attorney General of the United States, at the present term. No counsel has in either case appeared for the defendent in error. But we have the pamphlet arguments filed and referred to by Booth in the first case, as hereinbefore mentioned, also the opinions and arguments of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and of the judges who compose it, in full, and are enabled, therefore, to see the grounds on which they rely to support their decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be seen, from the foregoing statement of facts, that a judge of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin in the first of these cases, claimed and exercised the right to supervise and annul the proceedings of a commissioner of the United States, and to discharge a prisoner, who had been committed by the commissioner for an offence against the laws of this Government, and that this exercise of power by the judge was afterwards sanctioned and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the second case, the State court has gone a step furtner, and claimed and exercised jurisdiction over the proceedings and judgment of a District Court of the United States, and upon a summary and collateral proceeding, by habeas corpus, \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*514\u003c/span\u003e has set aside and annulled its judgment, and discharged a prisoner who had been tried and found guilty of an offence against the laws of the United States, and sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it further appears that the State court have not only claimed and exercised this jurisdiction, but have also determined that their decision is final and conclusive upon all the courts of the United States, and ordered their clerk to disregard and refuse obedience to the writ of error issued by this court, pursuant to the act of Congress of 1789, to bring here for examination and revision the judgment of the State court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThese propositions are new in the jurisprudence of the United States, as well as of the States; and the supremacy of the State courts over the courts of the United States, in cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, is now for the first time asserted and acted upon in the Supreme Court of a State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe supremacy is not, indeed, set forth distinctly and broadly, in so many words, in the printed opinions of the judges. It is intermixed with elaborate discussions of different provisions in the fugitive slave law, and of the privileges and power of the writ of habeas corpus. But the paramount power of the State court lies at the foundation of these decisions; for their commentaries upon the provisions of that law, and upon the privileges and power of the writ of habeas corpus, were out of place, and their judicial action upon them without authority of law, unless they had the power to revise and control the proceedings in the criminal case of which they were speaking; and their judgments, releasing the prisoner, and disregarding the writ of error from this court, can rest upon no other foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIf the judicial power exercised in this instance has been reserved to the States, no offence against the laws of the United States can be punished by their own courts, without the permission and according to the judgment of the courts of the State in which the party happens to be imprisoned; for, if the Supreme Court of Wisconsin possessed the power it has exercised in relation to offences against the act of Congress in question, \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*515\u003c/span\u003e it necessarily follows that they must have the same judicial authority in relation to any other law of the United States; and, consequently, their supervising and controlling power would embrace the whole criminal code of the United States, and extend to offences against our revenue laws, or any other law intended to guard the different departments of the General Government from fraud or violence. And it would embrace all crimes, from the highest to the lowest; including felonies, which are punished with death, as well as misdemeanors, which are punished by imprisonment. And, moreover, if the power is possessed by the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin, it must belong equally to every other State in the Union, when the prisoner is within its territorial limits; and it is very certain that the State courts would not always agree in opinion; and it would often happen, that an act which was admitted to be an offence, and justly punished, in one State, would be regarded as innocent, and indeed as praiseworthy, in another.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt would seem to be hardly necessary to do more than state the result to which these decisions of the State courts must inevitably lead. It is, of itself, a sufficient and conclusive answer; for no one will suppose that a Government which has now lasted nearly seventy years, enforcing its laws by its own tribunals, and preserving the union of the States, could have lasted a single year, or fulfilled the high trusts committed to it, if offences against its laws could not have been punished without the consent of the State in which the culprit was found.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe judges of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin do not distinctly state from what source they suppose they have derived this judicial power. There can be no such thing as judicial authority, unless it is conferred by a Government or sovereignty; and if the judges and courts of Wisconsin possess the jurisdiction they claim, they must derive it either from the United States or the State. It certainly has not been conferred on them by the United States; and it is equally clear it was not in the power of the State to confer it, even if it had attempted to do so; for no State can authorize one of its judges \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*516\u003c/span\u003e or courts to exercise judicial power, by habeas corpus or otherwise, within the jurisdiction of another and independent Government. And although the State of Wisconsin is sovereign within its territorial limits to a certain extent, yet that sovereignty is limited and restricted by the Constitution of the United States. And the powers of the General Government, and of the State, although both exist and are exercised within the same territorial limits, are yet separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres. And the sphere of action appropriated to the United States is as far beyond the reach of the judicial process issued by a State judge or a State court, as if the line of division was traced by landmarks and monuments visible to the eye. And the State of Wisconsin had no more power to authorize these proceedings of its judges and courts, than it would have had if the prisoner had been confined in Michigan, or in any other State of the Union, for an offence against the laws of the State in which he was imprisoned.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt is, however, due to the State to say, that we do not find this claim of paramount jurisdiction in the State courts over the courts of the United States asserted or countenanced by the Constitution or laws of the State. We find it only in the decisions of the judges of the Supreme Court. Indeed, at the very time these decisions were made, there was a statute of the State which declares that a person brought up on a habeas corpus shall be remanded, if it appears that he is confined:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"1st. By virtue of process, by any court or judge of the United States, in a case where such court or judge has exclusive jurisdiction; or,\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"2d. By virtue of the final judgment or decree of any competent court of civil or criminal jurisdiction.\" (Revised Statutes of the State of Wisconsin, 1849, ch. 124, page 629.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eEven, therefore, if these cases depended upon the laws of Wisconsin, it would be difficult to find in these provisions such a grant of judicial power as the Supreme Court claims to have derived from the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut, as we have already said, questions of this kind must \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*517\u003c/span\u003e always depend upon the Constitution and laws of the United States, and not of a State. The Constitution was not formed merely to guard the States against danger from foreign nations, but mainly to secure union and harmony at home; for if this object could be attained, there would be but little danger from abroad; and to accomplish this purpose, it was felt by the statesmen who framed the Constitution, and by the people who adopted it, that it was necessary that many of the rights of sovereignty which the States then possessed should be ceded to the General Government; and that, in the sphere of action assigned to it, it should be supreme, and strong enough to execute its own laws by its own tribunals, without interruption from a State or from State authorities. And it was evident that anything short of this would be inadequate to the main objects for which the Government was established; and that local interests, local passions or prejudices, incited and fostered by individuals for sinister purposes, would lead to acts of aggression and injustice by one State upon the rights of another, which would ultimately terminate in violence and force, unless there was a common arbiter between them, armed with power enough to protect and guard the rights of all, by appropriate laws, to be carried into execution peacefully by its judicial tribunals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe language of the Constitution, by which this power is granted, is too plain to admit of doubt or to need comment. It declares that \"this Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be passed in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut the supremacy thus conferred on this Government could not peacefully be maintained, unless it was clothed with judicial power, equally paramount in authority to carry it into execution; for if left to the courts of justice of the several States, conflicting decisions would unavoidably take place, and the local tribunals could hardly be expected to be always free \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*518\u003c/span\u003e from the local influences of which we have spoken. And the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, and the powers granted to the Federal Government, would soon receive different interpretations in different States, and the Government of the United States would soon become one thing in one State and another thing in another. It was essential, therefore, to its very existence as a Government, that it should have the power of establishing courts of justice, altogether independent of State power, to carry into effect its own laws; and that a tribunal should be established in which all cases which might arise under the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, whether in a State court or a court of the United States, should be finally and conclusively decided. Without such a tribunal, it is obvious that there would be no uniformity of judicial decision; and that the supremacy, (which is but another name for independence,) so carefully provided in the clause of the Constitution above referred to, could not possibly be maintained peacefully, unless it was associated with this paramount judicial authority.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAccordingly, it was conferred on the General Government, in clear, precise, and comprehensive terms. It is declared that its judicial power shall (among other subjects enumerated) extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that in such cases, as well as the others there enumerated, this court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as Congress shall make. The appellate power, it will be observed, is conferred on this court in all cases or suits in which such a question shall arise. It is not confined to suits in the inferior courts of the United States, but extends to all cases where such a question arises, whether it be in a judicial tribunal of a State or of the United States. And it is manifest that this ultimate appellate power in a tribunal created by the Constitution itself was deemed essential to secure the independence and supremacy of the General Government in the sphere of action assigned to it; to make the Constitution and laws of the United States uniform, and the same in every State; and to guard against evils which would \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*519\u003c/span\u003e inevitably arise from conflicting opinions between the courts of a State and of the United States, if there was no common arbiter authorized to decide between them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe importance which the framers of the Constitution attached to such a tribunal, for the purpose of preserving internal tranquillity, is strikingly manifested by the clause which gives this court jurisdiction over the sovereign States which compose this Union, when a controversy arises between them. Instead of reserving the right to seek redress for injustice from another State by their sovereign powers, they have bound themselves to submit to the decision of this court, and to abide by its judgment. And it is not out of place to say, here, that experience has demonstrated that this power was not unwisely surrendered by the States; for in the time that has already elapsed since this Government came into existence, several irritating and angry controversies have taken place between adjoining States, in relation to their respective boundaries, and which have sometimes threatened to end in force and violence, but for the power vested in this court to hear them and decide between them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe same purposes are clearly indicated by the different language employed when conferring supremacy upon the laws of the United States, and jurisdiction upon its courts. In the first case, it provides that \"this Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land, and obligatory upon the judges in every State.\" The words in italics show the precision and foresight which marks every clause in the instrument. The sovereignty to be created was to be limited in its powers of legislation, and if it passed a law not authorized by its enumerated powers, it was not to be regarded as the supreme law of the land, nor were the State judges bound to carry it into execution. And as the courts of a State, and the courts of the United States, might, and indeed certainly would, often differ as to the extent of the powers conferred by the General Government, it was manifest that serious controversies would arise between the authorities of the United States and of the States, which must be settled by force of arms, unless some \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*520\u003c/span\u003e tribunal was created to decide between them finally and with out appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe Constitution has accordingly provided, as far as human foresight could provide, against this danger. And in conferring judicial power upon the Federal Government, it declares that the jurisdiction of its courts shall extend to all cases arising under \"this Constitution\" and the laws of the United States \\x97 leaving out the words of restriction contained in the grant of legislative power which we have above noticed. The judicial power covers every legislative act of Congress, whether it be made within the limits of its delegated powers, or be an assumption of power beyond the grants in the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis judicial power was justly regarded as indispensable, not merely to maintain the supremacy of the laws of the United States, but also to guard the States from any encroachment upon their reserved rights by the General Government. And as the Constitution is the fundamental and supreme law, if it appears that an act of Congress is not pursuant to and within the limits of the power assigned to the Federal Government, it is the duty of the courts of the United States to declare it unconstitutional and void. The grant of judicial power is not confined to the administration of laws passed in pursuance to the provisions of the Constitution, nor confined to the interpretation of such laws; but, by the very terms of the grant, the Constitution is under their view when any act of Congress is brought before them, and it is their duty to declare the law void, and refuse to execute it, if it is not pursuant to the legislative powers conferred upon Congress. And as the final appellate power in all such questions is given to this court, controversies as to the respective powers of the United States and the States, instead of being determined by military and physical force, are heard, investigated, and finally settled, with the calmness and deliberation of judicial inquiry. And no one can fail to see, that if such an arbiter had not been provided, in our complicated system of government, internal tranquillity could not have been preserved; and if such controversies were left to arbitrament of physical force, our Government, State and National, would soon cease to be Governments \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*521\u003c/span\u003e of laws, and revolutions by force of arms would take the place of courts of justice and judicial decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIn organizing such a tribunal, it is evident that every precaution was taken, which human wisdom could devise, to fit it for the high duty with which it was intrusted. It was not left to Congress to create it by law; for the States could hardly be expected to confide in the impartiality of a tribunal created exclusively by the General Government, without any participation on their part. And as the performance of its duty would sometimes come in conflict with individual ambition or interests, and powerful political combinations, an act of Congress establishing such a tribunal might be repealed in order to establish another more subservient to the predominant political influences or excited passions of the day. This tribunal, therefore, was erected, and the powers of which we have spoken conferred upon it, not by the Federal Government, but by the people of the States, who formed and adopted that Government, and conferred upon it all the powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, which it now possesses. And in order to secure its independence, and enable it faithfully and firmly to perform its duty, it engrafted it upon the Constitution itself, and declared that this court should have appellate power in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. So long, therefore, as this Constitution shall endure, this tribunal must exist with it, deciding in the peaceful forms of judicial proceeding the angry and irritating controversies between sovereignties, which in other countries have been determined by the arbitrament of force.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThese principles of constitutional law are confirmed and illustrated by the clause which confers legislative power upon Congress. That power is specifically given in article 1, section 8, paragraph 18, in the following words:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUnder this clause of the Constitution, it became the duty of Congress to pass such laws as were necessary and proper to \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*522\u003c/span\u003e carry into execution the powers vested in the judicial department. And in the performance of this duty, the First Congress, at its first session, passed the act of 1789, ch. 20, entitled \"An act to establish the judicial courts of the United States.\" It will be remembered that many of the members of the Convention were also members of this Congress, and it cannot be supposed that they did not understand the meaning and intention of the great instrument which they had so anxiously and deliberately considered, clause by clause, and assisted to frame. And the law they passed to carry into execution the powers vested in the judicial department of the Government proves, past doubt, that their interpretation of the appellate powers conferred on this court was the same with that which we have now given; for by the 25th section of the act of 1789, Congress authorized writs of error to be issued from this court to a State court, whenever a right had been claimed under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and the decision of the State court was against it. And to make this appellate power effectual, and altogether independent of the action of State tribunals, this act further provides, that upon writs of error to a State court, instead of remanding the cause for a final decision in the State court, this court may at their discretion, if the cause shall have been once remanded before, proceed to a final decision of the same, and award execution.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThese provisions in the act of 1789 tell us, in language not to be mistaken, the great importance which the patriots and statesmen of the First Congress attached to this appellate power, and the foresight and care with which they guarded its free and independent exercise against interference or obstruction by States or State tribunals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, a right was claimed under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and the decision was against the right claimed; and it refuses obedience to the writ of error, and regards its own judgment as final. It has not only reversed and annulled the judgment of the District Court of the United States, but it has reversed and annulled the provisions of the Constitution itself, \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*523\u003c/span\u003e and the act of Congress of 1789, and made the superior and appellate tribunal the inferior and subordinate one.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not question the authority of State court, or judge, who is authorized by the laws of the State to issue the writ of habeas corpus, to issue it in any case where the party is imprisoned within its territorial limits, provided it does not appear, when the application is made, that the person imprisoned is in custody under the authority of the United States. The court or judge has a right to inquire, in this mode of proceeding, for what cause and by what authority the prisoner is confined within the territorial limits of the State sovereignty. And it is the duty of the marshal, or other person having the custody of the prisoner, to make known to the judge or court, by a proper return, the authority by which he holds him in custody. This right to inquire by process of habeas corpus, and the duty of the officer to make a return, grows, necessarily, out of the complex character of our Government, and the existence of two distinct and separate sovereignties within the same territorial space, each of them restricted in its powers, and each within its sphere of action, prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, independent of the other. But, after the return is made, and the State judge or court judicially apprized that the party is in custody under the authority of the United States, they can proceed no further. They then know that the prisoner is within the dominion and jurisdiction of another Government, and that neither the writ of habeas corpus, nor any other process issued under State authority, can pass over the line of division between the two sovereignties. He is then within the dominion and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. If he has committed an offence against their laws, their tribunals alone can punish him. If he is wrongfully imprisoned, their judicial tribunals can release him and afford him redress. And although, as we have said, it is the duty of the marshal, or other person holding him, to make known, by a proper return, the authority under which he detains him, it is at the same time imperatively his duty to obey the process of the United States, to hold the prisoner in custody under it, and to refuse obedience to the mandate or \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*524\u003c/span\u003e process of any other Government. And consequently it is his duty not to take the prisoner, nor suffer him to be taken, before a State judge or court upon a habeas corpus issued under State authority. No State judge or court, after they are judicially informed that the party is imprisoned under the authority of the United States, has any right to interfere with him, or to require him to be brought before them. And if the authority of a State, in the form of judicial process or otherwise, should attempt to control the marshal or other authorized officer or agent of the United States, in any respect, in the custody of his prisoner, it would be his duty to resist it, and to call to his aid any force that might be necessary to maintain the authority of law against illegal interference. No judicial process, whatever form it may assume, can have any lawful authority outside of the limits of the jurisdiction of the court or judge by whom it is issued; and an attempt to enforce it beyond these boundaries is nothing less than lawless violence.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNor is there anything in this supremacy of the General Government, or the jurisdiction of its judicial tribunals, to awaken the jealousy or offend the natural and just pride of State sovereignty. Neither this Government, nor the powers of which we are speaking, were forced upon the States. The Constitution of the United States, with all the powers conferred by it on the General Government, and surrendered by the States, was the voluntary act of the people of the several States, deliberately done, for their own protection and safety against injustice from one another. And their anxiety to preserve it in full force, in all its powers, and to guard against resistance to or evasion of its authority, on the part of a State, is proved by the clause which requires that the members of the State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers of the several States, (as well as those of the General Government,) shall be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution. This is the last and closing clause of the Constitution, and inserted when the whole frame of Government, with the powers hereinbefore specified, had been adopted by the Convention; and it was in that form, and with these powers, that the Constitution \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*525\u003c/span\u003e was submitted to the people of the several States, for their consideration and decision.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow, it certainly can be no humiliation to the citizen of a republic to yield a ready obedience to the laws as administered by the constituted authorities. On the contrary, it is among his first and highest duties as a citizen, because free government cannot exist without it. Nor can it be inconsistent with the dignity of a sovereign State to observe faithfully, and in the spirit of sincerity and truth, the compact into which it voluntarily entered when it became a State of this Union. On the contrary, the highest honor of sovereignty is untarnished faith. And certainly no faith could be more deliberately and solemnly pledged than that which every State has plighted to the other States to support the Constitution as it is, in all its provisions, until they shall be altered in the manner which the Constitution itself prescribes. In the emphatic language of the pledge required, it is to support this Constitution. And no power is more clearly conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States, than the power of this court to decide, ultimately and finally, all cases arising under such Constitution and laws; and for that purpose to bring here for revision, by writ of error, the judgment of a State court, where such questions have arisen, and the right claimed under them denied by the highest judicial tribunal in the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe are sensible that we have extended the examination of these decisions beyond the limits required by any intrinsic difficulty in the questions. But the decisions in question were made by the supreme judicial tribunal of the State; and when a court so elevated in its position has pronounced a judgment which, if it could be maintained, would subvert the very foundations of this Government, it seemed to be the duty of this court, when exercising its appellate power, to show plainly the grave errors into which the State court has fallen, and the consequences to which they would inevitably lead.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut it can hardly be necessary to point out the errors which followed their mistaken view of the jurisdiction they might lawfully exercise; because, if there was any defect of power in the commissioner, or in his mode of proceeding, it was for the \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*526\u003c/span\u003e tribunals of the United States to revise and correct it, and not for a State court. And as regards the decision of the District Court, it had exclusive and final jurisdiction by the laws of the United States; and neither the regularity of its proceedings nor the validity of its sentence could be called in question in any other court, either of a State or the United States, by habeas corpus or any other process.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut although we think it unnecessary to discuss these questions, yet, as they have been decided by the State court, and are before us on the record, and we are not willing to be misunderstood, it is proper to say that, in the judgment of this court, the act of Congress commonly called the fugitive slave law is, in all of its provisions, fully authorized by the Constitution of the United States; that the commissioner had lawful authority to issue the warrant and commit the party, and that his proceedings were regular and conformable to law. We have already stated the opinion and judgment of the court as to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court, and the appellate powers which this court is authorized and required to exercise. And if any argument was needed to show the wisdom and necessity of this appellate power, the cases before us sufficiently prove it, and at the same time emphatically call for its exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin must therefore be reversed in each of the cases now before the court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\u0027,\n",

On that account, they have been argued and considered together; and the following are the facts as they appear in the transcripts before us:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSherman M. Booth was charged before Winfield Smith, a commissioner duly appointed by the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, with having, on the 11th day of March, 1854, aided and abetted, at Milwaukee, in the said district, the escape of a fugitive slave from the deputy marshal, who had him in custody under a warrant issued by the district judge of the United States for that district, under the act of Congress of September 18, 1850.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUpon the examination before the commissioner, he was satisfied that an offence had been committed as charged, and that there was probable cause to believe that Booth had been guilty of it; and thereupon held him to bail to appear and answer before the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, on the first Monday in July then next ensuing. But on the 26th of May his bail or surety in the recognisance delivered him to the marshal, in the presence of the commissioner, and requested the commissioner to recommit Booth to the custody of the marshal, and he having failed to recognise again for his appearance before the District Court, the commissioner committed him to the custody of the marshal, to be delivered to the keeper of the jail until he should be discharged by due course of law.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBooth made application on the next day, the 27th of May, \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*508\u003c/span\u003e to A.D. Smith, one of the justices of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin, for a writ of habeas corpus, stating that he was restrained of his liberty by Stephen V.R. Ableman, marshal of the United States for that district, under the warrant of commitment hereinbefore mentioned; and alleging that his imprisonment was illegal, because the act of Congress of September 18, 1850, was unconstitutional and void; and also that the warrant was defective, and did not describe the offence created by that act, even if the act were valid.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUpon this application, the justice, on the same day, issued the writ of habeas corpus, directed to the marshal, requiring him forthwith to have the body of Booth before him, (the said justice,) together with the time and cause of his imprisonment. The marshal thereupon, on the day above mentioned, produced Booth, and made his return, stating that he was received into his custody as marshal on the day before, and held in custody by virtue of the warrant of the commissioner above mentioned, a copy of which he annexed to and returned with the writ.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTo this return Booth demurred, as not sufficient in law to justify his detention. And upon the hearing the justice decided that his detention was illegal, and ordered the marshal to discharge him and set him at liberty, which was accordingly done.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfterwards, on the 9th of June, in the same year, the marshal applied to the Supreme Court of the State for a certiorari, setting forth in his application the proceedings hereinbefore mentioned, and charging that the release of Booth by the justice was erroneous and unlawful, and praying that his proceedings might be brought before the Supreme Court of the State for revision.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe certiorari was allowed on the same day; and the writ was accordingly issued on the 12th of the same month, and returnable on the third Tuesday of the month; and on the 20th the return was made by the justice, stating the proceedings, as hereinbefore mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe case was argued before the Supreme Court of the State, and on the 19th of July it pronounced its judgment, affirming \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*509\u003c/span\u003e the decision of the associate justice discharging Booth from imprisonment, with costs against Ableman, the marshal.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfterwards, on the 26th of October, the marshal sued out a writ of error, returnable to this court on the first Monday of December, 1854, in order to bring the judgment here for revision; and the defendant in error was regularly cited to appear on that day; and the record and proceedings were certified to this court by the clerk of the State court in the usual form, in obedience to the writ of error. And on the 4th of December, Booth, the defendant in error, filed a memorandum in writing in this court, stating that he had been cited to appear here in this case, and that he submitted it to the judgment of this court on the reasoning in the argument and opinions in the printed pamphlets therewith sent.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the judgment was entered in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and before the writ of error was sued out, the State court entered on its record, that, in the final judgment it had rendered, the validity of the act of Congress of September 18, 1850, and of February 12, 1793, and the authority of the marshal to hold the defendant in his custody, under the process mentioned in his return to the writ of habeas corpus, were respectively drawn in question, and the decision of the court in the final judgment was against their validity, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis certificate was not necessary to give this court jurisdiction, because the proceedings upon their face show that these questions arose, and how they were decided; but it shows that at that time the Supreme Court of Wisconsin did not question their obligation to obey the writ of error, nor the authority of this court to re-examine their judgment in the cases specified. And the certificate is given for the purpose of placing distinctly on the record the points that were raised and decided in that court, in order that this court might have no difficulty in exercising its appellate power, and pronouncing its judgment upon all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe come now to the second case. At the January term of the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, after Booth had been set at liberty, and after the transcript of the proceedings in the case above mentioned had been \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*510\u003c/span\u003e returned to and filed in this court, the grand jury found a bill of indictment against Booth for the offence with which he was charged before the commissioner, and from which the State court had discharged him. The indictment was found on the 4th of January, 1855. On the 9th a motion was made, by counsel on behalf of the accused, to quash the indictment, which was overruled by the court; and he thereupon pleaded not guilty, upon which issue was joined. On the 10th a jury was called and appeared in court, when he challenged the array; but the challenge was overruled and the jury empanelled. The trial, it appears, continued from day to day, until the 13th, when the jury found him guilty in the manner and form in which he stood indicted in the fourth and fifth counts. On the 16th he moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, which motions were argued on the 20th, and on the 23d the court overruled the motions, and sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for one month, and to pay a fine of $1,000 and the costs of prosecution; and that he remain in custody until the sentence was complied with.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe have stated more particularly these proceedings, from a sense of justice to the District Court, as they show that every opportunity of making his defence was afforded him, and that his case was fully heard and considered.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the 26th of January, three days after the sentence was passed, the prisoner by his counsel filed his petition in the Supreme Court of the State, and with his petition filed a copy of the proceedings in the District Court, and also affidavits from the foreman and one other member of the jury who tried him, stating that their verdict was, guilty on the fourth and fifth counts, and not guilty on the other three; and stated in his petition that his imprisonment was illegal, because the fugitive slave law was unconstitutional; that the District Court had no jurisdiction to try or punish him for the matter charged against him, and that the proceedings and sentence of that court were absolute nullities in law. Various other objections to the proceedings are alleged, which are unimportant in the questions now before the court, and need not, therefore, be particularly stated. On the next day, the 27th, the court directed \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*511\u003c/span\u003e two writs of habeas corpus to be issued \\x97 one to the marshal, and one to the sheriff of Milwaukee, to whose actual keeping the prisoner was committed by the marshal, by order of the District Court. The habeas corpus directed each of them to produce the body of the prisoner, and make known the cause of his imprisonment, immediately after the receipt of the writ.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the 30th of January the marshal made his return, not acknowledging the jurisdiction, but stating the sentence of the District Court as his authority; that the prisoner was delivered to, and was then in the actual keeping of the sheriff of Milwaukee county, by order of the court, and he therefore had no control of the body of the prisoner; and if the sheriff had not received him, he should have so reported to the District Court, and should have conveyed him to some other place or prison, as the court should command.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the same day the sheriff produced the body of Booth before the State court, and returned that he had been committed to his custody by the marshal, by virtue of a transcript, a true copy of which was annexed to his return, and which was the only process or authority by which he detained him.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis transcript was a full copy of the proceedings and sentence in the District Court of the United States, as hereinbefore stated. To this return the accused, by his counsel, filed a general demurrer.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe court ordered the hearing to be postponed until the 2d of February, and notice to be given to the district attorney of the United States. It was accordingly heard on that day, and on the next, (February 3d,) the court decided that the imprisonment was illegal, and ordered and adjudged that Booth be, and he was by that judgment, forever discharged from that imprisonment and restraint, and he was accordingly set at liberty.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn the 21st of April next following, the Attorney General of the United States presented a petition to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, stating briefly the facts in the case, and at the same time presenting an exemplification of the proceedings hereinbefore stated, duly certified by the clerk of the State court, and averring in his petition that the State court had no \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*512\u003c/span\u003e jurisdiction in the case, and praying that a writ of error might issue to bring its judgment before this court to correct the error. The writ of error was allowed and issued, and, according to the rules and practice of the court, was returnable on the first Monday of December, 1855, and a citation for the defend ant in error to appear on that day was issued by the Chief Justice at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNo return having been made to this writ, the Attorney General, on the 1st of February, 1856, filed affidavits, showing that the writ of error had been duly served on the clerk of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, at his office, on the 30th of May, 1855, and the citation served on the defendant in error on the 28th of June, in the same year. And also the affidavit of the district attorney of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, setting forth that when he served the writ of error upon the clerk, as above mentioned, he was informed by the clerk, and has also been informed by one of the justices of the Supreme Court, which released Booth, \"that the court had directed the clerk to make no return to the writ of error, and to enter no order upon the journals or records of the court concerning the same.\" And, upon these proofs, the Attorney General moved the court for an order upon the clerk to make return to the writ of error, on or before the first day of the next ensuing term of this court. The rule was accordingly laid, and on the 22d of July, 1856, the Attorney General filed with the clerk of this court the affidavit of the marshal of the district of Wisconsin, that he had served the rule on the clerk on the 7th of the month above mentioned; and no return having been made, the Attorney General, on the 27th of February, 1857, moved for leave to file the certified copy of the record of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which he had produced with his application for the writ of error, and to docket the case in this court, in conformity with a motion to that effect made at the last term. And the court thereupon, on the 6th of March, 1857, ordered the copy of the record filed by the Attorney General to be received and entered on the docket of this court, to have the same effect and legal operation as if returned by the clerk with the writ of error, and that the case stand for argument \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*513\u003c/span\u003e at the next ensuing term, without further notice to either party.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe case was accordingly docketed, but was not reached for argument in the regular order and practice of the court until the present term.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis detailed statement of the proceedings in the different courts has appeared to be necessary in order to form a just estimate of the action of the different tribunals in which it has been heard, and to account for the delay in the final decision of a case, which, from its character, would seem to have demanded prompt action. The first case, indeed, was reached for trial two terms ago. But as the two cases are different portions of the same prosecution for the same offence, they unavoidably, to some extent, involve the same principles of law, and it would hardly have been proper to hear and decide the first before the other was ready for hearing and decision. They have accordingly been argued together, by the Attorney General of the United States, at the present term. No counsel has in either case appeared for the defendent in error. But we have the pamphlet arguments filed and referred to by Booth in the first case, as hereinbefore mentioned, also the opinions and arguments of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and of the judges who compose it, in full, and are enabled, therefore, to see the grounds on which they rely to support their decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be seen, from the foregoing statement of facts, that a judge of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin in the first of these cases, claimed and exercised the right to supervise and annul the proceedings of a commissioner of the United States, and to discharge a prisoner, who had been committed by the commissioner for an offence against the laws of this Government, and that this exercise of power by the judge was afterwards sanctioned and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the second case, the State court has gone a step furtner, and claimed and exercised jurisdiction over the proceedings and judgment of a District Court of the United States, and upon a summary and collateral proceeding, by habeas corpus, \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*514\u003c/span\u003e has set aside and annulled its judgment, and discharged a prisoner who had been tried and found guilty of an offence against the laws of the United States, and sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it further appears that the State court have not only claimed and exercised this jurisdiction, but have also determined that their decision is final and conclusive upon all the courts of the United States, and ordered their clerk to disregard and refuse obedience to the writ of error issued by this court, pursuant to the act of Congress of 1789, to bring here for examination and revision the judgment of the State court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThese propositions are new in the jurisprudence of the United States, as well as of the States; and the supremacy of the State courts over the courts of the United States, in cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, is now for the first time asserted and acted upon in the Supreme Court of a State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe supremacy is not, indeed, set forth distinctly and broadly, in so many words, in the printed opinions of the judges. It is intermixed with elaborate discussions of different provisions in the fugitive slave law, and of the privileges and power of the writ of habeas corpus. But the paramount power of the State court lies at the foundation of these decisions; for their commentaries upon the provisions of that law, and upon the privileges and power of the writ of habeas corpus, were out of place, and their judicial action upon them without authority of law, unless they had the power to revise and control the proceedings in the criminal case of which they were speaking; and their judgments, releasing the prisoner, and disregarding the writ of error from this court, can rest upon no other foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIf the judicial power exercised in this instance has been reserved to the States, no offence against the laws of the United States can be punished by their own courts, without the permission and according to the judgment of the courts of the State in which the party happens to be imprisoned; for, if the Supreme Court of Wisconsin possessed the power it has exercised in relation to offences against the act of Congress in question, \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*515\u003c/span\u003e it necessarily follows that they must have the same judicial authority in relation to any other law of the United States; and, consequently, their supervising and controlling power would embrace the whole criminal code of the United States, and extend to offences against our revenue laws, or any other law intended to guard the different departments of the General Government from fraud or violence. And it would embrace all crimes, from the highest to the lowest; including felonies, which are punished with death, as well as misdemeanors, which are punished by imprisonment. And, moreover, if the power is possessed by the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin, it must belong equally to every other State in the Union, when the prisoner is within its territorial limits; and it is very certain that the State courts would not always agree in opinion; and it would often happen, that an act which was admitted to be an offence, and justly punished, in one State, would be regarded as innocent, and indeed as praiseworthy, in another.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt would seem to be hardly necessary to do more than state the result to which these decisions of the State courts must inevitably lead. It is, of itself, a sufficient and conclusive answer; for no one will suppose that a Government which has now lasted nearly seventy years, enforcing its laws by its own tribunals, and preserving the union of the States, could have lasted a single year, or fulfilled the high trusts committed to it, if offences against its laws could not have been punished without the consent of the State in which the culprit was found.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe judges of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin do not distinctly state from what source they suppose they have derived this judicial power. There can be no such thing as judicial authority, unless it is conferred by a Government or sovereignty; and if the judges and courts of Wisconsin possess the jurisdiction they claim, they must derive it either from the United States or the State. It certainly has not been conferred on them by the United States; and it is equally clear it was not in the power of the State to confer it, even if it had attempted to do so; for no State can authorize one of its judges \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*516\u003c/span\u003e or courts to exercise judicial power, by habeas corpus or otherwise, within the jurisdiction of another and independent Government. And although the State of Wisconsin is sovereign within its territorial limits to a certain extent, yet that sovereignty is limited and restricted by the Constitution of the United States. And the powers of the General Government, and of the State, although both exist and are exercised within the same territorial limits, are yet separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres. And the sphere of action appropriated to the United States is as far beyond the reach of the judicial process issued by a State judge or a State court, as if the line of division was traced by landmarks and monuments visible to the eye. And the State of Wisconsin had no more power to authorize these proceedings of its judges and courts, than it would have had if the prisoner had been confined in Michigan, or in any other State of the Union, for an offence against the laws of the State in which he was imprisoned.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt is, however, due to the State to say, that we do not find this claim of paramount jurisdiction in the State courts over the courts of the United States asserted or countenanced by the Constitution or laws of the State. We find it only in the decisions of the judges of the Supreme Court. Indeed, at the very time these decisions were made, there was a statute of the State which declares that a person brought up on a habeas corpus shall be remanded, if it appears that he is confined:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"1st. By virtue of process, by any court or judge of the United States, in a case where such court or judge has exclusive jurisdiction; or,\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"2d. By virtue of the final judgment or decree of any competent court of civil or criminal jurisdiction.\" (Revised Statutes of the State of Wisconsin, 1849, ch. 124, page 629.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eEven, therefore, if these cases depended upon the laws of Wisconsin, it would be difficult to find in these provisions such a grant of judicial power as the Supreme Court claims to have derived from the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut, as we have already said, questions of this kind must \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*517\u003c/span\u003e always depend upon the Constitution and laws of the United States, and not of a State. The Constitution was not formed merely to guard the States against danger from foreign nations, but mainly to secure union and harmony at home; for if this object could be attained, there would be but little danger from abroad; and to accomplish this purpose, it was felt by the statesmen who framed the Constitution, and by the people who adopted it, that it was necessary that many of the rights of sovereignty which the States then possessed should be ceded to the General Government; and that, in the sphere of action assigned to it, it should be supreme, and strong enough to execute its own laws by its own tribunals, without interruption from a State or from State authorities. And it was evident that anything short of this would be inadequate to the main objects for which the Government was established; and that local interests, local passions or prejudices, incited and fostered by individuals for sinister purposes, would lead to acts of aggression and injustice by one State upon the rights of another, which would ultimately terminate in violence and force, unless there was a common arbiter between them, armed with power enough to protect and guard the rights of all, by appropriate laws, to be carried into execution peacefully by its judicial tribunals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe language of the Constitution, by which this power is granted, is too plain to admit of doubt or to need comment. It declares that \"this Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be passed in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut the supremacy thus conferred on this Government could not peacefully be maintained, unless it was clothed with judicial power, equally paramount in authority to carry it into execution; for if left to the courts of justice of the several States, conflicting decisions would unavoidably take place, and the local tribunals could hardly be expected to be always free \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*518\u003c/span\u003e from the local influences of which we have spoken. And the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, and the powers granted to the Federal Government, would soon receive different interpretations in different States, and the Government of the United States would soon become one thing in one State and another thing in another. It was essential, therefore, to its very existence as a Government, that it should have the power of establishing courts of justice, altogether independent of State power, to carry into effect its own laws; and that a tribunal should be established in which all cases which might arise under the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, whether in a State court or a court of the United States, should be finally and conclusively decided. Without such a tribunal, it is obvious that there would be no uniformity of judicial decision; and that the supremacy, (which is but another name for independence,) so carefully provided in the clause of the Constitution above referred to, could not possibly be maintained peacefully, unless it was associated with this paramount judicial authority.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAccordingly, it was conferred on the General Government, in clear, precise, and comprehensive terms. It is declared that its judicial power shall (among other subjects enumerated) extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that in such cases, as well as the others there enumerated, this court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as Congress shall make. The appellate power, it will be observed, is conferred on this court in all cases or suits in which such a question shall arise. It is not confined to suits in the inferior courts of the United States, but extends to all cases where such a question arises, whether it be in a judicial tribunal of a State or of the United States. And it is manifest that this ultimate appellate power in a tribunal created by the Constitution itself was deemed essential to secure the independence and supremacy of the General Government in the sphere of action assigned to it; to make the Constitution and laws of the United States uniform, and the same in every State; and to guard against evils which would \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*519\u003c/span\u003e inevitably arise from conflicting opinions between the courts of a State and of the United States, if there was no common arbiter authorized to decide between them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe importance which the framers of the Constitution attached to such a tribunal, for the purpose of preserving internal tranquillity, is strikingly manifested by the clause which gives this court jurisdiction over the sovereign States which compose this Union, when a controversy arises between them. Instead of reserving the right to seek redress for injustice from another State by their sovereign powers, they have bound themselves to submit to the decision of this court, and to abide by its judgment. And it is not out of place to say, here, that experience has demonstrated that this power was not unwisely surrendered by the States; for in the time that has already elapsed since this Government came into existence, several irritating and angry controversies have taken place between adjoining States, in relation to their respective boundaries, and which have sometimes threatened to end in force and violence, but for the power vested in this court to hear them and decide between them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe same purposes are clearly indicated by the different language employed when conferring supremacy upon the laws of the United States, and jurisdiction upon its courts. In the first case, it provides that \"this Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land, and obligatory upon the judges in every State.\" The words in italics show the precision and foresight which marks every clause in the instrument. The sovereignty to be created was to be limited in its powers of legislation, and if it passed a law not authorized by its enumerated powers, it was not to be regarded as the supreme law of the land, nor were the State judges bound to carry it into execution. And as the courts of a State, and the courts of the United States, might, and indeed certainly would, often differ as to the extent of the powers conferred by the General Government, it was manifest that serious controversies would arise between the authorities of the United States and of the States, which must be settled by force of arms, unless some \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*520\u003c/span\u003e tribunal was created to decide between them finally and with out appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe Constitution has accordingly provided, as far as human foresight could provide, against this danger. And in conferring judicial power upon the Federal Government, it declares that the jurisdiction of its courts shall extend to all cases arising under \"this Constitution\" and the laws of the United States \\x97 leaving out the words of restriction contained in the grant of legislative power which we have above noticed. The judicial power covers every legislative act of Congress, whether it be made within the limits of its delegated powers, or be an assumption of power beyond the grants in the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis judicial power was justly regarded as indispensable, not merely to maintain the supremacy of the laws of the United States, but also to guard the States from any encroachment upon their reserved rights by the General Government. And as the Constitution is the fundamental and supreme law, if it appears that an act of Congress is not pursuant to and within the limits of the power assigned to the Federal Government, it is the duty of the courts of the United States to declare it unconstitutional and void. The grant of judicial power is not confined to the administration of laws passed in pursuance to the provisions of the Constitution, nor confined to the interpretation of such laws; but, by the very terms of the grant, the Constitution is under their view when any act of Congress is brought before them, and it is their duty to declare the law void, and refuse to execute it, if it is not pursuant to the legislative powers conferred upon Congress. And as the final appellate power in all such questions is given to this court, controversies as to the respective powers of the United States and the States, instead of being determined by military and physical force, are heard, investigated, and finally settled, with the calmness and deliberation of judicial inquiry. And no one can fail to see, that if such an arbiter had not been provided, in our complicated system of government, internal tranquillity could not have been preserved; and if such controversies were left to arbitrament of physical force, our Government, State and National, would soon cease to be Governments \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*521\u003c/span\u003e of laws, and revolutions by force of arms would take the place of courts of justice and judicial decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIn organizing such a tribunal, it is evident that every precaution was taken, which human wisdom could devise, to fit it for the high duty with which it was intrusted. It was not left to Congress to create it by law; for the States could hardly be expected to confide in the impartiality of a tribunal created exclusively by the General Government, without any participation on their part. And as the performance of its duty would sometimes come in conflict with individual ambition or interests, and powerful political combinations, an act of Congress establishing such a tribunal might be repealed in order to establish another more subservient to the predominant political influences or excited passions of the day. This tribunal, therefore, was erected, and the powers of which we have spoken conferred upon it, not by the Federal Government, but by the people of the States, who formed and adopted that Government, and conferred upon it all the powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, which it now possesses. And in order to secure its independence, and enable it faithfully and firmly to perform its duty, it engrafted it upon the Constitution itself, and declared that this court should have appellate power in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. So long, therefore, as this Constitution shall endure, this tribunal must exist with it, deciding in the peaceful forms of judicial proceeding the angry and irritating controversies between sovereignties, which in other countries have been determined by the arbitrament of force.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThese principles of constitutional law are confirmed and illustrated by the clause which confers legislative power upon Congress. That power is specifically given in article 1, section 8, paragraph 18, in the following words:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUnder this clause of the Constitution, it became the duty of Congress to pass such laws as were necessary and proper to \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*522\u003c/span\u003e carry into execution the powers vested in the judicial department. And in the performance of this duty, the First Congress, at its first session, passed the act of 1789, ch. 20, entitled \"An act to establish the judicial courts of the United States.\" It will be remembered that many of the members of the Convention were also members of this Congress, and it cannot be supposed that they did not understand the meaning and intention of the great instrument which they had so anxiously and deliberately considered, clause by clause, and assisted to frame. And the law they passed to carry into execution the powers vested in the judicial department of the Government proves, past doubt, that their interpretation of the appellate powers conferred on this court was the same with that which we have now given; for by the 25th section of the act of 1789, Congress authorized writs of error to be issued from this court to a State court, whenever a right had been claimed under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and the decision of the State court was against it. And to make this appellate power effectual, and altogether independent of the action of State tribunals, this act further provides, that upon writs of error to a State court, instead of remanding the cause for a final decision in the State court, this court may at their discretion, if the cause shall have been once remanded before, proceed to a final decision of the same, and award execution.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThese provisions in the act of 1789 tell us, in language not to be mistaken, the great importance which the patriots and statesmen of the First Congress attached to this appellate power, and the foresight and care with which they guarded its free and independent exercise against interference or obstruction by States or State tribunals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, a right was claimed under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and the decision was against the right claimed; and it refuses obedience to the writ of error, and regards its own judgment as final. It has not only reversed and annulled the judgment of the District Court of the United States, but it has reversed and annulled the provisions of the Constitution itself, \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*523\u003c/span\u003e and the act of Congress of 1789, and made the superior and appellate tribunal the inferior and subordinate one.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not question the authority of State court, or judge, who is authorized by the laws of the State to issue the writ of habeas corpus, to issue it in any case where the party is imprisoned within its territorial limits, provided it does not appear, when the application is made, that the person imprisoned is in custody under the authority of the United States. The court or judge has a right to inquire, in this mode of proceeding, for what cause and by what authority the prisoner is confined within the territorial limits of the State sovereignty. And it is the duty of the marshal, or other person having the custody of the prisoner, to make known to the judge or court, by a proper return, the authority by which he holds him in custody. This right to inquire by process of habeas corpus, and the duty of the officer to make a return, grows, necessarily, out of the complex character of our Government, and the existence of two distinct and separate sovereignties within the same territorial space, each of them restricted in its powers, and each within its sphere of action, prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, independent of the other. But, after the return is made, and the State judge or court judicially apprized that the party is in custody under the authority of the United States, they can proceed no further. They then know that the prisoner is within the dominion and jurisdiction of another Government, and that neither the writ of habeas corpus, nor any other process issued under State authority, can pass over the line of division between the two sovereignties. He is then within the dominion and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. If he has committed an offence against their laws, their tribunals alone can punish him. If he is wrongfully imprisoned, their judicial tribunals can release him and afford him redress. And although, as we have said, it is the duty of the marshal, or other person holding him, to make known, by a proper return, the authority under which he detains him, it is at the same time imperatively his duty to obey the process of the United States, to hold the prisoner in custody under it, and to refuse obedience to the mandate or \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*524\u003c/span\u003e process of any other Government. And consequently it is his duty not to take the prisoner, nor suffer him to be taken, before a State judge or court upon a habeas corpus issued under State authority. No State judge or court, after they are judicially informed that the party is imprisoned under the authority of the United States, has any right to interfere with him, or to require him to be brought before them. And if the authority of a State, in the form of judicial process or otherwise, should attempt to control the marshal or other authorized officer or agent of the United States, in any respect, in the custody of his prisoner, it would be his duty to resist it, and to call to his aid any force that might be necessary to maintain the authority of law against illegal interference. No judicial process, whatever form it may assume, can have any lawful authority outside of the limits of the jurisdiction of the court or judge by whom it is issued; and an attempt to enforce it beyond these boundaries is nothing less than lawless violence.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNor is there anything in this supremacy of the General Government, or the jurisdiction of its judicial tribunals, to awaken the jealousy or offend the natural and just pride of State sovereignty. Neither this Government, nor the powers of which we are speaking, were forced upon the States. The Constitution of the United States, with all the powers conferred by it on the General Government, and surrendered by the States, was the voluntary act of the people of the several States, deliberately done, for their own protection and safety against injustice from one another. And their anxiety to preserve it in full force, in all its powers, and to guard against resistance to or evasion of its authority, on the part of a State, is proved by the clause which requires that the members of the State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers of the several States, (as well as those of the General Government,) shall be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution. This is the last and closing clause of the Constitution, and inserted when the whole frame of Government, with the powers hereinbefore specified, had been adopted by the Convention; and it was in that form, and with these powers, that the Constitution \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*525\u003c/span\u003e was submitted to the people of the several States, for their consideration and decision.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow, it certainly can be no humiliation to the citizen of a republic to yield a ready obedience to the laws as administered by the constituted authorities. On the contrary, it is among his first and highest duties as a citizen, because free government cannot exist without it. Nor can it be inconsistent with the dignity of a sovereign State to observe faithfully, and in the spirit of sincerity and truth, the compact into which it voluntarily entered when it became a State of this Union. On the contrary, the highest honor of sovereignty is untarnished faith. And certainly no faith could be more deliberately and solemnly pledged than that which every State has plighted to the other States to support the Constitution as it is, in all its provisions, until they shall be altered in the manner which the Constitution itself prescribes. In the emphatic language of the pledge required, it is to support this Constitution. And no power is more clearly conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States, than the power of this court to decide, ultimately and finally, all cases arising under such Constitution and laws; and for that purpose to bring here for revision, by writ of error, the judgment of a State court, where such questions have arisen, and the right claimed under them denied by the highest judicial tribunal in the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe are sensible that we have extended the examination of these decisions beyond the limits required by any intrinsic difficulty in the questions. But the decisions in question were made by the supreme judicial tribunal of the State; and when a court so elevated in its position has pronounced a judgment which, if it could be maintained, would subvert the very foundations of this Government, it seemed to be the duty of this court, when exercising its appellate power, to show plainly the grave errors into which the State court has fallen, and the consequences to which they would inevitably lead.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut it can hardly be necessary to point out the errors which followed their mistaken view of the jurisdiction they might lawfully exercise; because, if there was any defect of power in the commissioner, or in his mode of proceeding, it was for the \u003cspan class\u003d\"star-pagination\"\u003e*526\u003c/span\u003e tribunals of the United States to revise and correct it, and not for a State court. And as regards the decision of the District Court, it had exclusive and final jurisdiction by the laws of the United States; and neither the regularity of its proceedings nor the validity of its sentence could be called in question in any other court, either of a State or the United States, by habeas corpus or any other process.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut although we think it unnecessary to discuss these questions, yet, as they have been decided by the State court, and are before us on the record, and we are not willing to be misunderstood, it is proper to say that, in the judgment of this court, the act of Congress commonly called the fugitive slave law is, in all of its provisions, fully authorized by the Constitution of the United States; that the commissioner had lawful authority to issue the warrant and commit the party, and that his proceedings were regular and conformable to law. We have already stated the opinion and judgment of the court as to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court, and the appellate powers which this court is authorized and required to exercise. And if any argument was needed to show the wisdom and necessity of this appellate power, the cases before us sufficiently prove it, and at the same time emphatically call for its exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin must therefore be reversed in each of the cases now before the court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/div\u003e\u0027,\n",

At the January term of the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, after Booth had been set at liberty, and after the transcript of the proceedings in the case above mentioned had been returned to and filed in this court, the grand jury found a bill of indictment against Booth for the offence with which he was charged before the commissioner, and from which the State court had discharged him. The indictment was found on the 4th of January, 1855. On the 9th a motion was made, by counsel on behalf of the accused, to quash the indictment, which was overruled by the court; and he thereupon pleaded not guilty, upon which issue was joined. On the 10th a jury was called and appeared in court, when he challenged the array; but the challenge was overruled and the jury empanelled. The trial, it appears, continued from day to day, until the 13th, when the jury found him guilty in the manner and form in which he stood indicted in the fourth and fifth counts. On the 16th he moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, which motions were argued on the 20th, and on the 23d the court overruled the motions, and sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for one month, and to pay a fine of $1,000 and the costs of prosecution; and that he remain in custody until the sentence was complied with.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p14\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eWe have stated more particularly these proceedings, from a sense of justice to the District Court, as they show that every opportunity of making his defence was afforded him, and that his case was fully heard and considered.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p15\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eOn the 26th of January, three days after the sentence was passed, the prisoner by his counsel filed his petition in the Supreme Court of the State, and with his petition filed a copy of the proceedings in the District Court, and also affidavits from the foreman and one other member of the jury who tried him, stating that their verdict was, guilty on the fourth and fifth counts, and not guilty on the other three; and stated in his petition that his imprisonment was illegal, because the fugitive slave law was unconstitutional; that the District Court had no jurisdiction to try or punish him for the matter charged against him, and that the proceedings and sentence of that court were absolute nullities in law. Various other objections to the proceedings are alleged, which are unimportant in the questions now before the court, and need not, therefore, be particularly stated. On the next day, the 27th, the court directed two writs of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e to be issued\u0026#8212;one to the marshal, and one to the sheriff of Milwaukee, to whose actual keeping the prisoner was committed by the marshal, by order of the District Court. The \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e directed each of them to produce the body of the prisoner, and make known the cause of his imprisonment, immediately after the receipt of the writ.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p16\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eOn the 30th of January the marshal made his return, not acknowledging the jurisdiction, but stating the sentence of the District Court as his authority; that the prisoner was delivered to, and was then in the actual keeping of the sheriff of Milwaukee county, by order of the court, and he therefore had no control of the body of the prisoner; and if the sheriff had not received him, he should have so reported to the District Court, and should have conveyed him to some other place or prison, as the court should command.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p17\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eOn the same day the sheriff produced the body of Booth before the State court, and returned that he had been committed to his custody by the marshal, by virtue of a transcript, a true copy of which was annexed to his return, and which was the only process or authority by which he detained him.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p18\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThis transcript was a full copy of the proceedings and sentence in the District Court of the United States, as hereinbefore stated.

The writ of error was allowed and issued, and, according to the rules and practice of the court, was returnable on the first Monday of December, 1855, and a citation for the defendant in error to appear on that day was issued by the Chief Justice at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p21\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eNo return having been made to this writ, the Attorney General, on the 1st of February, 1856, filed affidavits, showing that the writ of error had been duly served on the clerk of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, at his office, on the 30th of May, 1855, and the citation served on the defendant in error on the 28th of June, in the same year. And also the affidavit of the district attorney of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, setting forth that when he served the writ of error upon the clerk, as above mentioned, he was informed by the clerk, and has also been informed by one of the justices of the Supreme Court, which released Booth, \\\u0027\u003ci\u003ethat the court had directed the clerk to make no return to the writ of error, and to enter no order upon the journals or records of the court concerning the same\u003c/i\u003e.\\\u0027 And, upon these proofs, the Attorney General moved the court for an order upon the clerk to make return to the writ of error, on or before the first day of the next ensuing term of this court.

And the court thereupon, on the 6th of March, 1857, ordered the copy of the record filed by the Attorney General to be received and entered on the docket of this court, to have the same effect and legal operation as if returned by the clerk with the writ of error, and that the case stand for argument at the next ensuing term, without further notice to either party.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p22\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe case was accordingly docketed, but was not reached for argument in the regular order and practice of the court until the present term.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p23\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThis detailed statement of the proceedings in the different courts has appeared to be necessary in order to form a just estimate of the action of the different tribunals in which it has been heard, and to account for the delay in the final decision of a case, which, from its character, would seem to have demanded prompt action. The first case, indeed, was reached for trial two terms ago. But as the two cases are different portions of the same prosecution for the same offence, they unavoidably, to some extent, involve the same principles of law, and it would hardly have been proper to hear and decide the first before the other was ready for hearing and decision. They have accordingly been argued together, by the Attorney General of the United States, at the present term. No counsel has in either case appeared for the defendant in error. But we have the pamphlet arguments filed and referred to by Booth in the first case, as hereinbefore mentioned, also the opinions and arguments of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and of the judges who compose it, in full, and are enabled, therefore, to see the grounds on which they rely to support their decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p24\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIt will be seen, from the foregoing statement of facts, that a judge of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin in the first of these cases, claimed and exercised the right to supervise and annul the proceedings of a commissioner of the United States, and to discharge a prisoner, who had been committed by the commissioner for an offence against the laws of this Government, and that this exercise of power by the judge was afterwards sanctioned and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p25\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIn the second case, the State court has gone a step further, and claimed and exercised jurisdiction over the proceedings and judgment of a District Court of the United States, and upon a summary and collateral proceeding, by \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, has set aside and annulled its judgment, and discharged a prisoner who had been tried and found guilty of an offence against the laws of the United States, and sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p26\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eAnd it further appears that the State court have not only claimed and exercised this jurisdiction, but have also determined that their decision is final and conclusive upon all the courts of the United States, and ordered their clerk to disregard and refuse obedience to the writ of error issued by this court, pursuant to the act of Congress of 1789, to bring here for examination and revision the judgment of the State court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p27\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThese propositions are new in the jurisprudence of the United States, as well as of the States; and the supremacy of the State courts over the courts of the United States, in cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, is now for the first time asserted and acted upon in the Supreme Court of a State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p28\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe supremacy is not, indeed, set forth distinctly and broadly, in so many words, in the printed opinions of the judges. It is intermixed with elaborate discussions of different provisions in the fugitive slave law, and of the privileges and power of the writ of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e. But the paramount power of the State court lies at the foundation of these decisions; for their commentaries upon the provisions of that law, and upon the privileges and power of the writ of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, were out of place, and their judicial action upon them without authority of law, unless they had the power to revise and control the proceedings in the criminal case of which they were speaking; and their judgments, releasing the prisoner, and disregarding the writ of error from this court, can rest upon no other foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p29\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIf the judicial power exercised in this instance has been reserved to the States, no offence against the laws of the United States can be punished by their own courts, without the permission and according to the judgment of the courts of the State in which the party happens to be imprisoned; for, if the Supreme Court of Wisconsin possessed the power it has exercised in relation to offences against the act of Congress in question, it necessarily follows that they must have the same judicial authority in relation to any other law of the United States; and, consequently, their supervising and controlling power would embrace the whole criminal code of the United States, and extend to offences against our revenue laws, or any other law intended to guard the different departments of the General Government from fraud or violence. And it would embrace all crimes, from the highest to the lowest; including felonies, which are punished with death, as well as misdemeanors, which are punished by imprisonment. And, moreover, if the power is possessed by the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin, it must belong equally to every other State in the Union, when the prisoner is within its territorial limits; and it is very certain that the State courts would not always agree in opinion; and it would often happen, that an act which was admitted to be an offence, and justly punished, in one State, would be regarded as innocent, and indeed as praiseworthy, in another.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p30\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIt would seem to be hardly necessary to do more than state the result to which these decisions of the State courts must inevitably lead. It is, of itself, a sufficient and conclusive answer; for no one will suppose that a Government which has now lasted nearly seventy years, enforcing its laws by its own tribunals, and preserving the union of the States, could have lasted a single year, or fulfilled the high trusts committed to it, if offences against its laws could not have been punished without the consent of the State in which the culprit was found.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p31\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe judges of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin do not distinctly state from what source they suppose they have derived this judicial power. There can be no such thing as judicial authority, unless it is conferred by a Government or sovereignty; and if the judges and courts of Wisconsin possess the jurisdiction they claim, they must derive it either from the United States or the State. It certainly has not been conferred on them by the United States; and it is equally clear it was not in the power of the State to confer it, even if it had attempted to do so; for no State can authorize one of its judges or courts to exercise judicial power, by \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e or otherwise, within the jurisdiction of another and independent Government. And although the State of Wisconsin is sovereign within its territorial limits to a certain extent, yet that sovereignty is limited and restricted by the Constitution of the United States. And the powers of the General Government, and of the State, although both exist and are exercised within the same territorial limits, are yet separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres. And the sphere of action appropriated to the United States is as far beyond the reach of the judicial process issued by a State judge or a State court, as if the line of division was traced by landmarks and monuments visible to the eye. And the State of Wisconsin had no more power to authorize these proceedings of its judges and courts, than it would have had if the prisoner had been confined in Michigan, or in any other State of the Union, for an offence against the laws of the State in which he was imprisoned.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p32\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIt is, however, due to the State to say, that we do not find this claim of paramount jurisdiction in the State courts over the courts of the United States asserted or countenanced by the Constitution or laws of the State.

The Constitution was not formed merely to guard the States against danger from foreign nations, but mainly to secure union and harmony at home; for if this object could be attained, there would be but little danger from abroad; and to accomplish this purpose, it was felt by the statesmen who framed the Constitution, and by the people who adopted it, that it was necessary that many of the rights of sovereighty which the States then possessed should be ceded to the General Government; and that, in the sphere of action assigned to it, it should be supreme, and strong enough to execute its own laws by its own tribunals, without interruption from a State or from State authorities. And it was evident that anything short of this would be inadequate to the main objects for which the Government was established; and that local interests, local passions or prejudices, incited and fostered by individuals for sinister purposes, would lead to acts of aggression and injustice by one State upon the rights of another, which would ultimately terminate in violence and force, unless there was a common arbiter between them, armed with power enough to protect and guard the rights of all, by appropriate laws, to be carried into execution peacefully by its judicial tribunals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p37\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e37\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe language of the Constitution, by which this power is granted, is too plain to admit of doubt or to need comment. It declares that \\\u0027this Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be passed in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\\\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p38\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e38\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eBut the supremacy thus conferred on this Government could not peacefully be maintained, unless it was clothed with judicial power, equally paramount in authority to carry it into execution; for if left to the courts of justice of the several States, conflicting decisions would unavoidably take place, and the local tribunals could hardly be expected to be always free from the local influences of which we have spoken. And the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, and the powers granted to the Federal Government, would soon receive different interpretations in different States, and the Government of the United States would soon become one thing in one State and another thing in another. It was essential, therefore, to its very existence as a Government, that it should have the power of establishing courts of justice, altogether independent of State power, to carry into effect its own laws; and that a tribunal should be established in which all cases which might arise under the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, whether in a State court or a court of the United States, should be finally and conclusively decided. Without such a tribunal, it is obvious that there would be no uniformity of judicial decision; and that the supremacy, (which is but another name for independence,) so carefully provided in the clause of the Constitution above referred to, could not possibly be maintained peacefully, unless it was associated with this paramount judicial authority.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p39\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e39\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eAccordingly, it was conferred on the General Government, in clear, precise, and comprehensive terms. It is declared that its judicial power shall (among other subjects enumerated) extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that in such cases, as well as the others there enumerated, this court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as Congress shall make. The appellate power, it will be observed, is conferred on this court in all cases or suits in which such a question shall arise. It is not confined to suits in the inferior courts of the United States, but extends to all cases where such a question arises, whether it be in a judicial tribunal of a State or of the United States. And it is manifest that this ultimate appellate power in a tribunal created by the Constitution itself was deemed essential to secure the independence and supremacy of the General Government in the sphere of action assigned to it; to make the Constitution and laws of the United States uniform, and the same in every State; and to guard against evils which would inevitably arise from conflicting opinions between the courts of a State and of the United States, if there was no common arbiter authorized to decide between them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p40\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e40\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe importance which the framers of the Constitution attached to such a tribunal, for the purpose of preserving internal tranquillity, is strikingly manifested by the clause which gives this court jurisdiction over the sovereign States which compose this Union, when a controversy arises between them. Instead of reserving the right to seek redress for injustice from another State by their sovereign powers, they have bound themselves to submit to the decision of this court, and to abide by its judgment. And it is not out of place to say, here, that experience has demonstrated that this power was not unwisely surrendered by the States; for in the time that has already elapsed since this Government came into existence, several irritating and angry controversies have taken place between adjoining States, in relation to their respective boundaries, and which have sometimes threatened to end in force and violence, but for the power vested in this court to hear them and decide between them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p41\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e41\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe same purposes are clearly indicated by the different language employed when conferring supremacy upon the laws of the United States, and jurisdiction upon its courts. In the first case, it provides that \\\u0027this Constitution, and the laws of the United States \u003ci\u003ewhich shall be made in pursuance thereof\u003c/i\u003e, shall be the supreme law of the land, and obligatory upon the judges in every State.\\\u0027 The words in italics show the precision and foresight which marks every clause in the instrument. The sovereignty to be created was to be limited in its powers of legislation, and if it passed a law not authorized by its enumerated powers, it was not to be regarded as the supreme law of the land, nor were the State judges bound to carry it into execution. And as the courts of a State, and the courts of the United States, might, and indeed certainly would, often differ as to the extent of the powers conferred by the General Government, it was manifest that serious controversies would arise between the authorities of the United States and of the States, which must be settled by force of arms, unless some tribunal was created to decide between them finally and with out appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p42\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e42\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe Constitution has accordingly provided, as far as human foresight could provide, against this danger. And in conferring judicial power upon the Federal Government, it declares that the jurisdiction of its courts shall extend to all cases arising under \\\u0027this Constitution\\\u0027 and the laws of the United States\u0026#8212;leaving out the words of restriction contained in the grant of legislative power which we have above noticed. The judicial power covers every legislative act of Congress, whether it be made within the limits of its delegated powers, or be an assumption of power beyond the grants in the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p43\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e43\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThis judicial power was justly regarded as indispensable, not merely to maintain the supremacy of the laws of the United States, but also to guard the States from any encroachment upon their reserved rights by the General Government. And as the Constitution is the fundamental and supreme law, if it appears that an act of Congress is not pursuant to and within the limits of the power assigned to the Federal Government, it is the duty of the courts of the United States to declare it unconstitutional and void. The grant of judicial power is not confined to the administration of laws passed in pursuance to the provisions of the Constitution, nor confined to the interpretation of such laws; but, by the very terms of the grant, the Constitution is under their view when any act of Congress is brought before them, and it is their duty to declare the law void, and refuse to execute it, if it is not pursuant to the legislative powers conferred upon Congress. And as the final appellate power in all such questions is given to this court, controversies as to the respective powers of the United States and the States, instead of being determined by military and physical force, are heard, investigated, and finally settled, with the calmness and deliberation of judicial inquiry. And no one can fail to see, that if such an arbiter had not been provided, in our complicated system of government, internal tranquillity could not have been preserved; and if such controver sies were left to arbitrament of physical force, our Government, State and National, would soon cease to be Governments of laws, and revolutions by force of arms would take the place of courts of justice and judicial decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p44\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e44\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIn organizing such a tribunal, it is evident that every precaution was taken, which human wisdom could devise, to fit it for the high duty with which it was intrusted. It was not left to Congress to create it by law; for the States could hardly be expected to confide in the impartiality of a tribunal created exclusively by the General Government, without any participation on their part. And as the performance of its duty would sometimes come in conflict with individual ambition or interests, and powerful political combinations, an act of Congress establishing such a tribunal might be repealed in order to establish another more subservient to the predominant political influences or excited passions of the day. This tribunal, therefore, was erected, and the powers of which we have spoken conferred upon it, not by the Federal Government, but by the people of the States, who formed and adopted that Government, and conferred upon it all the powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, which it now possesses. And in order to secure its independence, and enable it faithfully and firmly to perform its duty, it engrafted it upon the Constitution itself, and declared that this court should have appellate power in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. So long, therefore, as this Constitution shall endure, this tribunal must exist with it, deciding in the peaceful forms of judicial proceeding the angry and irritating controversies between sovereignties, which in other countries have been determined by the arbitrament of force.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p45\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e45\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThese principles of constitutional law are confirmed and illustrated by the clause which confers legislative power upon Congress. That power is specifically given in article 1, section 8, paragraph 18, in the following words:\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p46\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e46\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003e\\\u0027To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\\\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p47\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e47\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eUnder this clause of the Constitution, it became the duty of Congress to pass such laws as were necessary and proper to carry into execution the powers vested in the judicial department. And in the performance of this duty, the First Congress, at its first session, passed the act of 1789, ch. 20, entitled \\\u0027\u003ci\u003eAn act to establish the judicial courts of the United States\u003c/i\u003e.\\\u0027 It will be remembered that many of the members of the Convention were also members of this Congress, and it cannot be supposed that they did not understand the meaning and intention of the great instrument which they had so anxiously and deliberately considered, clause by clause, and assisted to frame. And the law they passed to carry into execution the powers vested in the judicial department of the Government proves, past doubt, that their interpretation of the appellate powers conferred on this court was the same with that which we have now given; for by the 25th section of the act of 1789, Congress authorized writs of error to be issued from this court to a State court, whenever a right had been claimed under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and the decision of the State court was against it. And to make this appellate power effectual, and altogether independent of the action of State tribunals, this act further provides, that upon writs of error to a State court, instead of remanding the cause for a final decision in the State court, this court may at their discretion, if the cause shall have been once remanded before, proceed to a final decision of the same, and award execution.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p48\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e48\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThese provisions in the act of 1789 tell us, in language not to be mistaken, the great importance which the patriots and statement of the First Congress attached to this appellate power, and the foresight and care with which they guarded its free and independent exercise against interference or obstruction by States or State tribunals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p49\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e49\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eIn the case before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, a right was claimed under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and the decision was against the right claimed; and it refuses obedience to the writ of error, and regards its own judgment as final. It has not only reversed and annulled the judgment of the District Court of the United States, but it has reversed and annulled the provisions of the Constitution itself, and the act of Congress of 1789, and made the superior and appellate tribunal the inferior and subordinate one.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p50\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e50\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eWe do not question the authority of State court, or judge, who is authorized by the laws of the State to issue the writ of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, to issue it in any case where the party is imprisoned within its territorial limits, provided it does not appear, when the application is made, that the person imprisoned is in custody under the authority of the United States. The court or judge has a right to inquire, in this mode of proceeding, for what cause and by what authority the prisoner is confined within the territorial limits of the State sovereignty. And it is the duty of the marshal, or other person having the custody of the prisoner, to make known to the judge or court, by a proper return, the authority by which he holds him in custody. This right to inquire by process of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, and the duty of the officer to make a return, a grows, necessarily, out of the complex character of our Government, and the existence of two distinct and separate sovereignties within the same territorial space, each of them restricted in its powers, and each within its sphere of action, prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, independent of the other. But, after the return is made, and the State judge or court judicially apprized that the party is in custody under the authority of the United States, they can proceed no further. They then know that the prisoner is within the dominion and jurisdiction of another Government, and that neither the writ of \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e, nor any other process issued under State authority, can pass over the line of division between the two sovereignties. He is then within the dominion and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. If he has committed an offence against their laws, their tribunals alone can punish him. If he is wrongfully imprisoned, their judicial tribunals can release him and afford him redress. And although, as we have said, it is the duty of the marshal, or other person holding him, to make known, by a proper return, the authority under which he detains him, it is at the same time imperatively his duty to obey the process of the United States, to hold the prisoner in custody under it, and to refuse obedience to the mandate or process of any other Government. And consequently it is his duty not to take the prisoner, nor suffer him to be taken, before a State judge or court upon a \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e issued under State authority. No State judge or court, after they are judicially informed that the party is imprisoned under the authority of the United States, has any right to interfere with him, or to require him to be brought before them. And if the authority of a State, in the form of judicial process or otherwise, should attempt to control the marshal or other authorized officer or agent of the United States, in any respect, in the custody of his prisoner, it would be his duty to resist it, and to call to his aid any force that might be necessary to maintain the authority of law against illegal interference. No judicial process, whatever form it may assume, can have any lawful authority outside of the limits of the jurisdiction of the court or judge by whom it is issued; and an attempt to enforce it beyond these boundaries is nothing less than lawless violence.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p51\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e51\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eNor is there anything in this supremacy of the General Government, or the jurisdiction of its judicial tribunals, to awaken the jealousy or offend the natural and just pride of State sovereignty. Neither this Government, nor the powers of which we are speaking, were forced upon the States. The Constitution of the United States, with all the powers conferred by it on the General Government, and surrendered by the States, was the voluntary act of the people of the several States, deliberately done, for their own protection and safety against injustice from one another. And their anxiety to preserve it in full force, in all its powers, and to guard against resistance to or evasion of its authority, on the part of a State, is proved by the clause which requires that the members of the State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers of the several States, (as well as those of the General Government,) shall be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution. This is the last and closing clause of the Constitution, and inserted when the whole frame of Government, with the powers hereinbefore specified, had been adopted by the Convention; and it was in that form, and with these powers, that the Constitution was submitted to the people of the several States, for their consideration and decision.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p52\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e52\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eNow, it certainly can be no humiliation to the citizen of a republic to yield a ready obedience to the laws as administered by the constituted authorities. On the contrary, it is among his first and highest duties as a citizen, because free government cannot exist without it. Nor can it be inconsistent with the dignity of a sovereign State to observe faithfully, and in the spirit of sincerity and truth, the compact into which it voluntarily entered when it became a State of this Union. On the contrary, the highest honor of sovereignty is untarnished faith. And certainly no faith could be more deliberately and solemnly pledged than that which every State has plighted to the other States to support the Constitution as it is, in all its provisions, until they shall be altered in the manner which the Constitution itself prescribes. In the emphatic language of the pledge required, it is \u003ci\u003eto support this Constitution\u003c/i\u003e. And no power is more clearly conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States, than the power of this court to decide, ultimately and finally, all cases arising under such Constitution and laws; and for that purpose to bring here for revision, by writ of error, the judgment of a State court, where such questions have arisen, and the right claimed under them denied by the highest judicial tribunal in the State.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p53\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e53\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eWe are sensible that we have extended the examination of these decisions beyond the limits required by any intrinsic difficulty in the questions. But the decisions in question were made by the supreme judicial tribunal of the State; and when a court so elevated in its position has pronounced a judgment which, if it could be maintained, would subvert the very foundations of this Government, it seemed to be the duty of this court, when exercising its appellate power, to show plainly the grave errors into which the State court has fallen, and the consequences to which they would inevitably lead.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p54\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e54\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eBut it can hardly be necessary to point out the errors which followed their mistaken view of the jurisdiction they might lawfully exercise; because, if there was any defect of power in the commissioner, or in his mode of proceeding, it was for the tribunals of the United States to revise and correct it, and not for a State court. And as regards the decision of the District Court, it had exclusive and final jurisdiction by the laws of the United States; and neither the regularity of its proceedings nor the validity of its sentence could be called in question in any other court, either of a State or the United States, by \u003ci\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/i\u003e or any other process.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p55\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e55\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eBut although we think it unnecessary to discuss these questions, yet, as they have been decided by the State court, and are before us on the record, and we are not willing to be misunderstood, it is proper to say that, in the judgment of this court, the act of Congress commonly called the fugitive slave law is, in all of its provisions, fully authorized by the Constitution of the United States; that the commissioner had lawful authority to issue the warrant and commit the party, and that his proceedings were regular and conformable to law. We have already stated the opinion and judgment of the court as to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court, and the appellate powers which this court is authorized and required to exercise. And if any argument was needed to show the wisdom and necessity of this appellate power, the cases before us sufficiently prove it, and at the same time emphatically call for its exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u003cdiv class\u003d\"num\" id\u003d\"p56\"\u003e\\n      \u003cspan class\u003d\"num\"\u003e56\u003c/span\u003e\\n      \u003cp class\u003d\"indent\"\u003eThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin must therefore be reversed in each of the cases now before the court.\u003c/p\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\\n    \u0027"
